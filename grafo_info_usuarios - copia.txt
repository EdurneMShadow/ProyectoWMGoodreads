      Finished: Excellent writing. Each character was portrayed with depth. I kept thinking that I should quote this line or that, but this was impossible without giving spoilers. You must read the book to get into each of these characters and to submerge yourself into their lives. The book is not only...

      Have you ever seen the painting <i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i> by Johannes Vermeer? No? Then, have a look at it:<br /><br /><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Johannes_Vermeer_(1632-1675)_-_The_Girl_With_The_Pearl_Earring_(1665).jpg" class="gr-hostedUserImg" /><br /><br /><s>Isn't it beautiful?</s><br /><br />I hadn't seen it until a few months ago, in a class I was taking at the university called “film appreciation”. My professor wanted to show us the movie that goes by the na...

      This book is gorgeously written. I love that Chevalier makes up all these lives to give a back story to just this one painting. Well, that's not true. We actually see the painting of three or four of Vermeer's 35 through Griet's eyes. I know that I had to constantly pull up images of his painting...

      I loved this. I don't say that often enough about a book. I was impressed with the writing, completely invested in the story and pleased with the ending. It's not easy to tick all those boxes, especially in a relatively short story. What more can I say.

      Girl With a Pearl Earring is such a beautifully written book with a compelling story. I find the story about young Griet working for Johannes Vermeer fascinating. How Tracy Chevalier used the painting of Girl with a Pearl Earring to weave such a fantastic story. Griet is just an ordinary girl, ne...

      This was a pleasant diversion. This novel about a pretty maid who appeared in one of Vermeer's paintings is easy to slip into, didn't ask much of me, and kept me entertained for a few days. <br /><br />Is it great literature? No. Was it turned into a decent movie? Yes. Would I recommend the book? Depends. Th...

      Αυτό το βιβλίο είναι κατάλληλο για όσους αγαπάνε τα ιστορικά μυθιστορήματα, τις πολλές πολλές περιγραφές στην αφήγηση και την ζωγραφική, ειδικά την τέχνη του Βερμέερ. Γραμμένο σε πρώτο πρόσωπο από την οπτική γωνία της ηρωίδας, που όπως είπα γίνεται με μια περιγραφική αφήγηση. Μιλά πολύ για τα τοπ...

      Gorgeous painting, deeper appreciation of art; mediocre, annoying book<br /><br />This is a book that fictionalizes what might have been behind the famous Vermeer painting, "Girl with a Pearl Earring".

      My favorite reading genre's are historical fiction, art and art history, and romance; well, this book has all of these elements which made it a treat for me. I have read most of Tracy Chevalier's work so I appreciate her ability to craft a good story. After his death Vermeer and even his painting...

      Delicato come una pennellata, intenso come il blu oltremare. L’arte e la narrazione di mescolano come olio e pigmenti, rivelando mille sfumature: i quadri di Vermeer prendono vita, si rivelano, diventano i personaggi di contorno alla protagonista.<br />Visto le poche informazioni che abbiamo sulla vita...

      So the parts when Vermeer was actually being a painter were interesting. Seeing as I slogged through this on account of a recommendation that arose from an art-class lecture on Vermeer, I was hoping that the art stuff would at least deliver. <br /><br />But it's not a good sign when a book's most compelling...

The society of the time classified everyone as a "have" or a "have not". For a girl who was in between it was a matter of time before she was forced to one side o...

      I've been hearing good things about this book for years. WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, everyone I know??

      Most of us know the painting, if not by name, but by sight at least. You might have even watched the movie starring Colin Firth (!!) and Scarlett Johanssen.

      I wrote a paper on artistic expression using Girl with a Pearl Earring as a source, since it is a painting, a movie, and a book. It provided me fascinating fodder, a really good read, and a good grade on my paper. This is a wonderful study in repression and tiny details. There are some beautiful...

      Love this story, love Vermeer's work. Over 2 years a quiet and obedient maid named Griet goes to live as a servant for Johannes Vermeer and his family.

      This book features one of my favorite book heroines of all time. Griet is competent, intelligent and observant.

      Girl With a Pearl Earring tells a short story using a lot of words. Even though the novel spans more than a decade, not too much of note happens besides Vermeer's painting.

      I know almost nothing about art, but even I can tell that Girl With a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer is a brilliant painting; 'captivating' is probably the best word to describe it.

      Okay, here is the thing. I like dark and twisted stories. The twisted plotlines and authentically scarred characters pull me and I am hooked. Gillian Flynn wrote such a story line very well in <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/150754615" rel="nofollow">Sharp Objects</a>.

      What can I say about this book that hasn't been said better by Wiesel himself? Powerful and moving. My copy has his 1986 Nobel Acceptance Speech at the end, and there is so much there that applies to this moment in our history that it's eerie.

      Frankenstein es y será una de las novelas más representativas del Romanticismo. Contiene muchos elementos: la dualidad Victor/Monstruo, que en cierta manera es una forma de temática del doble, el sufrimiento del que sabe que va a perder (en ambos casos), el titanismo romántico claramente expuesto...

      Mucho se ha hablado de <i>Frankenstein</i>. Se interpreta como una crítica al desarrollo científico, cuando este sobrepasa el curso natural de las cosas; se interpreta como una crítica a la religión y nuestra relación con Dios; hasta se ha dicho que es una alegoría a los miedos que surgen durante un emb...

      It is almost a pity that the story of <i>Frankenstein</i> is so well known because far too many people neglect to bother reading Mary Shelley’s novel under the assumption that they already know the story. This is a shame because <i> Frankenstein</i> is beautifully written, very dark and scary but also quite po...

      I don’t really know what I was expecting – though ‘more’ comes to mind. Let’s start with what I liked about this book. I liked the idea that the monster is ‘made’ a monster by the treatment he receives from humanity. He is ugly and humanity does like to punish the ugly - this is a universal truth...

      Like Victor Frankenstein’s creation - it promised to be amazing and it seemed to work perfectly in theory but after being assembled together, it left its creator cold and horrified - this classic novel, after setting up some very interesting premises, left me disappointed.<br /><br />The book’s beginning was...

      Everyone has probably either watched one of the multiple adaptions of Mary Shelley's novel or at least heard about the monster created by Victor Frankenstein, but if you haven't read the book itself, then you probably don't know the story at all.
