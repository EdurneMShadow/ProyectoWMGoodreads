  <description>Will Grayson meets Will Grayson. One cold night, in a most unlikely corner of Chicago, two strangers are about to cross paths. From that moment on, their world will collide and lives intertwine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not that far from Evanston to Naperville, but Chicago suburbanites Will Grayson and Will Grayson might as well live on different planets. When fate delivers them both to the same surprising crossroads, the Will Graysons find their lives overlapping and hurtling in new and unexpected directions. With a push from friends new and old - including the massive, and massively fabulous, Tiny Cooper, offensive lineman and musical theater auteur extraordinaire - Will and Will begin building toward respective romantic turns-of-heart and the epic production of history's most awesome high school musical.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Fantastic review, although I have to disagree with you on Tiny. I didn't see him as self-centered as much as hungry for love. And I think those are different things. I thought the whole thing with his play was fabulous, and I saw his accepting of this need to be loved as not egotistical, but somehow humble. An acceptance of his own humanity.<br /><br />Still, I love your writing and I'll be looking for more of your reviews!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Your review is spot-on. So many things about Tiny just seemed poorly contrived. At first, I thought he was a variation on the popular "manic pixie dream girl" type of character, and that Tiny would eventually reveal his perpetually hyper, unrealistic, flamboyant, loud self to be just one facet of a deeper, more multifaceted, more human personality. But no. Although Tiny does eventually get some depth, he's more of a puddle than a lake (or a kiddie pool). In a novel that tried to be mostly realistic, Tiny was a character that was totally unrealistic... and as you pointed out, the book was mostly about him. That's a major problem.<br /><br />John Green on "Manic Pixie Dream Girls": <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sparksflyup.com/2008/10/on-destruction-of-manic-pixie-dream.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparksflyup.com/2008/10/on...</a>]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Nice, well-thought review, but there's a few small points that irked me:<br /><br />"felt set up and obvious." It felt set up because they WERE set up. By Tiny.<br /><br />"Would an overly outgoing theater performer fall for a dark moody goth kid in one night?" Did you miss the part where Will#1 said Tiny falls in love every hour on the hour? Tiny/Will2 were supposed to not make sense together, because, as Will2 pointed out, it wasn't about his loving him, it was about saving him, in his big gay Tiny way.<br /><br />The tolerant high-school bit. Tiny's gayness is accepted by his school largely because Tiny is a FORCE. He's the best player on the school's football team and he's just generally forced himself into the lfe of the school, whereas Will2 is a moody goth kid that no one at his school likes anyway, so of course he's treated like crap about it.<br /><br />That's all :) otherwise, even though I disagree I think your review is pretty solid.]]></body>

Maybe Mark could put it in all caps or at the beginning of the spoiler paragraphs instead of the end of the non-spoilery ones? Then it might actually stand out.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I entirely agree with your review. I realize that Will Grayson 1 declaration of "love" to Tiny was supposed to read as the expression of his evolution into a human being capable of real feeling. What it does read like in fact is his grovelling to this extraordinarily self-centered "friend" who disrespects him in front of virtually the whole school community (in the play) and dosn't even treat his declaration of deep friendship with respect. It felt all the more wrong because the compensatory relationship with Jane had, as you suggest, a very superficial feel. This culminates in the brief passage where WG1 dismisses his own self as a "sentimentalist". Great review, thank you.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I really enjoyed your review. While I was reading WG, WG I had a lot of the same thoughts - Tiny is rather unlikable in many ways, WG #1 doesn't have much to identify him and Jane is rather plain etc ... somehow though once I finished, I was so utterly captivated that I kind of forgot all of that. One thing I would say in the book's defense is that (spoiler alert) when the Isaac thing blows up, I gotta tell you - I totally felt that. I felt betrayed, confused, lost, angry - I so got what it meant to have Isaac and then the way it was taken away really moved me. I can't remember the last time I resonated so much with a plot twist. Also, by the end of the off Broadway production, I must say, I was appreciating Tiny, too. I guess when a book hits an emotional spot/is entertaining and enjoyable to get through, I find myself more forgiving than usual ...]]></body>

I hear everything you said about this book (as a matter of perspective I disagree, but that is the beauty of books and Goodreads that we get to read and discuss and agree and disagree) and I think that you would really like Boy Meets Boy. : o)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This is the best review I read about this book and after finishing it, I couldn't agree more. I could not STAND Tiny, but I did start to develop an acceptance of the moody Will. This was more likely due to the fact he underwent more of a "change of character" than the other Will did. The other Will just seemed boring to me, and honestly I didn't approve of Jane. I wish they could have threw in some other girl for him to fall in love with.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA["If I had to sum it up, reading Levithan (for me personally!!) is like reading a vivid depiction of a car wreck that's so well done it makes you imagine what it would be like to be in one. It's downright impressive, but why would you want to relive that?" PERFECT description.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I completely agree with this review. It was all about Tiny and Grayson, whereas nothing really happened with Will.<br /><br />He just seemed to be there so the book could have two Will Graysons... I mean, I can not mark anything of what happened to Will after we meet Grayson...<br /><br />This is a fantastic review and I look forward to seeing more from you.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thanks for pointing out that the characters were written by the two different authors...<br />It makes sense then that I liked one Will Grayson and loathed the other...<br />(I liked Evanston, straight Will Grayson, even though I thought he was a self-righteous prick. I groaned when it was Naperville Will Grayson's turn to tell the story. His inconsistency and obsessive-compulsive boring "I'm so unique and the only one who feels sad" tasted like pickle juice and ear wax.<br />I enjoyed the humor in the book, but the book was little about the wills, and more about how a fat giant gay football player can be rich, talented, sweet, have mysterious blue eyes, egotistical, selfless kind, rude, -- essentially everything you love, hate, and want for yourself, but still be haunted... Or but then he also gets to be the troubled hero...<br /><br />It sounds like I hated it, but I actually dug it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thank you sooooo very much for this. This is exactly what I thought about this and completely agree with you about Tiny. I HATE HIM. This is the best review for this book. I still like the book but not as much as I like John Green's other books.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I only read half of you're comment and let me just say. I love the way you talked about the book because I felt the exact same way about the hole book. The cat in the box made no fucking sense to me. The book was basically about Tiny so why did they name it will Grayson. I thought the ending would be better. I loved Gay Grayson so damn much!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree - I think Tiny falling in love with Grayson so fast did seen to be a bit of a stretch. I think if we had been able to see Tiny's other failed relationships, and how he relates to people are vastly different from him, it would have been more believable. However, I think we do kind of see that when it comes to Tiny's friendship with Will, who is opposite in personality. <br /><br />I also think Tiny is a great character because of his flaws. Yes, he's flawed, but he admits it. He's very well fleshed out because of his interaction with the two Wills. He may think that his problems are larger than other's problems, but that's his flaw. I think that what helps this book is that we don't love the characters, and neither do we have to, to appreciate them.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[While this is a well written review, I respectfully disagree. While I am sure I would have a hard time being friends with someone like Tiny, I think he plays an interesting role. Through Tiny, both Will Graysons learn that their experiences and pain are about more than just themselves. Not every book has to have deep and mysterious relationships to be good. For once it was nice to see the simplicity of Will and Jane's relationship. Besides, I think the main point of the book wasn't Will and Jane's, but Will and Will and Tiny and friendship. I like how Will goes off on Tiny in the dugout about how not all love is sexual. It is nice to read a young adult novel that is not all about sex. So, to sum up, I see many of the points you made about the book, but have to respectfully disagree. Even with some annoying characters, I found I enjoyed the book. As for the ending, I'm ok with using my imagination and taking it from where the book left off.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Yeah, the book being titled WG WG really bothered me right after I finished the book that, like you said, is almost entirely about Tiny and his not-so-tiny role. I just think their collab hasn't worked so well compared ro their individual greatness. I've read couple of DL's already before this so I know how well he is and how he lost it here. On the other hand, this is my first JG read so I wasn't so much of disappointed since I haven't had a taste of his writing before which made my experience in reading Looking for Alaska a real WOOOOOW! Far from my experience with these Wills :) Perhaps not every "two" is better than one because they, for me, are better off alone in their own novels. :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I just finished reading "Will Grayson, Will Grayson" myself and this review aligns very well with most of my overall feelings. I think one of the biggest problems with this novel, for me, was how much Tiny seemed to outshine both of the Will Graysons making them almost like secondary characters - shadows to his overly bright light.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I have to disagree with this review because I for one loved every part of this book. Well, maybe not the first Will Grayson because he did change but not enough to be really seen. But even though the other Will Grayson was really morbid, I still liked him because he was so real. This is a kid who deals with depression, not a lot of money, and a single parent. This happens to a lot of people. This gives the book an air of realism. Also I have to disagree anyone who says Tiny is an over-bearing character. Even though the title is Will Grayson, Will Grayson, it doesn't make a difference. Take a song for instance, the title is usually something that is mentioned throughout the song, but is that the only thing there ? There are other parts of the song, like the verse. The verse is usually longer than the chorus (where the song title comes from)*if it seems like I babbling, I'm sorry but please stick with me I'm getting to my point soon* My point is that Tiny is a very lovable character. It also shows that you really don't need to care about what others think of you. You don't need to hide yourself because you're afraid of being a social outcast.]]></body>
