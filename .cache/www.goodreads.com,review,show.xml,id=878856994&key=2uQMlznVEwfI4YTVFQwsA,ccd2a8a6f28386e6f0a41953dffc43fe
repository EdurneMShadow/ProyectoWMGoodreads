  <description>To many readers, who have perhaps known &lt;i&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/i&gt; only at second hand, the original may well come as a surprise. When Mary Shelley began it, she was only eighteen, though she was already Shelley's mistress and Byron's friend. In her preface she explains how she and Shelley spent part of a wet summer with Byron in Switzerland, amusing themselves by reading and writing ghost stories. Her contribution was &lt;i&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/i&gt;, a story about a student of natural philosophy who learns the secret of imparting life to a creature constructed from bones he has collected in charnel-houses. The story is not a study of the macabre, as such, but rather a study of how man uses his power, through science, to manipulate and pervert his own destiny, and this makes it a profoundly disturbing book.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Loved the review, Anne! And I really liked the warning at the beginning. I've been getting complaint comments from the humorless about my 1 star review of this. It's like fans of the book want to school me on its hidden excellence. Why? Do they think I'll suddenly come to the conclusion that my own opinion is invalid? <u>I think</u> it's a poorly executed book. Another person's love for it isn't going to change that!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA['Hidden' excellence is a great way to put it, Jason. I figured since it was considered classic, my review had the potential to attract a few humorless intellectual trolls. Sorry you had to deal with them. Kidding...I think that's hilarious!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[It’s been a few years since I read this but I think the Paradise Lost reference in the book ties into the meaning behind the story - the fall of man, creator and man, etc. There’s lots of other ideas going on too – the subtitle, The Modern Prometheus, for example, with Frankenstein playing with fire/forbidden knowledge. It could also be read as a manifestation of real fears of the time where bodies were being dug up to be studied by unscrupulous doctors – those who dug up bodies were called “resurrection men”. A lot of 19th century monsters were manifestations of contemporary fears – Dracula symbolised rampant sexual disease, Mr Hyde was substance abuse, and so on. <br /><br />But you’re right, it is written in an insufferable way. You could put it down to this being Shelley’s first novel or that she was still a teenager, but it’s still a chore to get through.]]></body>

It makes me think that maybe I should read it over again and see if anything changes for me. People make different connections and it's good to see that.

Frankenstein is interesting from a philosophical perspective if you're into that sort of thing, but not so much from an entertainment viewpoint which is what we look for here. <br />It's hard now to believe that the Romantics were like the rock stars of their era.]]></body>

Or (God forbid) that we all act like the losers on Jersey Shore. <br />What's really hard to believe isn't that the Romantics were considered rock stars, it's the people we consider rock stars <i>now</i>. <br />But you're right, entertainment value isn't why people read Frankenstein. <br />I'm never going to 'better' myself at this rate...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Anne wrote: "Alright, I'll give you that they used different phrases, even different syntax. But I'm calling bullshit on the rest of it.

I also enjoy graphic novels/comics and I can see where, from that perspective or in comparison to Bill and Ted (which I also liked), it wouldn't seem to make sense though. <br />I like the book. For example, I find the man/God dichotomy in Frankenstein interesting in relation to what the Shelleys were experiencing socially and politically. <br />I did note on the reviews, however, that there are people here that enjoyed this novel for the sake of the story as well so it is, like most things, a matter of personal preference.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Maybe in an era where the only books you had available to entertain you were the King James and a little Shakespeare or Dickens, this might've been considered groundbreaking. It's like if you'd never read any comics and your only available exposure was Jeph Loeb or Dan DiDio or Mark Millar or Alan Moore :) Of course you'd think this was the shit (looking back on some of my earliest comics reviews, that's exactly what delusions of early minimal comparison I was under - it's a wonder of miracles that Ellis &amp; Ennis were among my first re-introductions to comics, or I might be a very sheltered and weakly critical guy even now).<br /><br />And Jeff mentioned Salinger? Hah, I was a right bastard when they assigned that to me in high school. While the rest of my 'gifted' (aka 'weirdos') class lapped it up, I took such a strong dislike to CitR that the essay I wrote on it was entitled "Why I Hate The Catcher in the Rye". I'd love to find that and post it verbatim as a Goodreads review - it's probably awful, precocious and indulgent, but then any of my scathing reviews here could be accused of the same no?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[You're right, Gary. Personal preference plays a huge role in every book we read. I loved quite a few books that massive amounts of friends DNF'd or gave low ratings to. It's all good, and most of us on here love to debate for the sake of...debating? I like to hear different opinions on books (like yours), but I might have a <i>teensy</i> competitive streak in me that wants to convince everyone to see things my way. I hope I didn't offend, it's all in fun.]]></body>

I enjoy reading your reviews and seeing your perspective. I also like to hear other opinions and your reviews are well written and informative. I especially like your graphic novel reviews. For example, I am looking forward to reading Aquaman which is a title I hadn't thought about in a long time.]]></body>
