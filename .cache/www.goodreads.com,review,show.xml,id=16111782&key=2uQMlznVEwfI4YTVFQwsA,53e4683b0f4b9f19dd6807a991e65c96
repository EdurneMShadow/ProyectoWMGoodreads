  <description>An ingenious code hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci. A desperate race through the cathedrals and castles of Europe. An astonishing truth concealed for centuries . . . unveiled at last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Quite to the contrary, I think the message is the problem for many people. That said, I agree the writing could certainly improve. For my part, sometimes I enjoy good stories where the writing isn't perfect so long as it's not to the point where it jars me. I didn't find this to be the case with Da Vinci Code. The Celestine Prophecy, for example, was so bad, I simply couldn't read it. If some people with more acute literary tastes than I felt the same way about Da Vinci Code, then I can't fault them. It just wasn't my experience. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[For Mindy --<br /><br />And it's not to say that Brown's is in any way the only take on feminism in religion. It is just one and, at least from my point of view, a good story as well (if not so well written). Hopefully, those who are introduced to these ideas by Brown will be curious and explore other works that tackle the subject as well -- like "Holy Blood, Holy Grain," or the "Silence of John" for a more Christian take on the issue. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[For Jeff --<br /><br />Gotta agree with Mindy on this one. Womens' voices have been excluded from the religious narrative or only strictly confined to certain roles. The issue is something that Da Vinci code only begins to explore. And, in this case, it is only through the lens of a male protagonist on a journey of discovery. <br /><br />Sometimes, there can be truth in fiction so long as, even though the story is technically untrue, it reveals something that is true about society. If you're interested in learning more about truth in fiction, you might want to take a look at Tim O'Brian's "How to Tell a True War Story."]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hi :) I liked your review. Every body have their own point of view. All of us percieve matter differently. Perception. Well, I'm not making much sense right now since I am not in a mood to actually write. But having read your review - I just thought that I ought to say, I do agree with your perception. That's it. And I think I wrote a review about the book too - kinda similar. Am tired, since I just returned from my summer vacation. Shall check in later. Till then.<br /><br />]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hi :) Did you read 'The Lost Symbol'? Well, history seems to be repeating itself! Anyways, I liked it. It certainly was not a waste of time. Maybe for those who'd seen the movie National Treasure and those of you who live in America a book on DC and its Symbology is ... Mundane? But for me an outsider, it was added knowledge. I may not be able to see or visit DC, but reading about it, somehow brings it closer. Anyways it was a nice book to read :) ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Robert wrote: "For Jeff --<br /><br />Gotta agree with Mindy on this one. Womens' voices have been excluded from the religious narrative or only strictly confined to certain roles. The issue is something that Da Vinci co..."</i><br /><br />I have not read the book and it sounds as though I will not agree with alot of religious beliefs in the book, but I may attempt to read it just so I will have knowledge of what message it is trying to put forth.<br /><br />But I will tell you all that in the Holy Word which is the Bible, (divinely inspired by God) there are scriptures that tell exactly what the roll of women are in the church and tell us that we are no less important then man.<br /><br />1 Cor 11:3 shows the CORRECT order of God, His Son, man and woman<br />1 Tim 2: 11-14, Eph 5:22-25 tells how woman are to conduct themselves in the assembly of a congregation and with men. And how men are to treat women.<br />1 Pet 3:7 Woman are not seen as a lesser being in the eyes of God...men and women together are heirs of the grace of life, although men are to treat us with honor and as a weaker vessel.<br /><br />]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I couldn't believe there were so many negative reviews and ratings!<br /><br />I haven't noticed anything in his writing that was 'shitty', in my limited opinion. I'm not a great reader, but I know how to make slight differentiation on writing level. <br /><br />What I liked most: the factual bits. For a teenager, it was a real treat to learn new things.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I totally agree with Adeola. I think that's what's so special about some of us teenagers. We have our own minds and aren't as persuaded by what the church is pushing on everyone.<br />I'm not fully done with the book (Got about 1/6th left), I'm finding it a good book. Then again I'm a Satanist so I despise the church anyways, however I am open minded.]]></body>
