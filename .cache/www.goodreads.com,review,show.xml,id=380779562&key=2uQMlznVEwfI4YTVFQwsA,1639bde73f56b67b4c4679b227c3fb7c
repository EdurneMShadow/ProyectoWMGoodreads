  <description>The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it, To Kill A Mockingbird became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.</description>

So, I won't say you HAVE to watch it...But I'd sure put it ahead of Upstairs/Downstairs in the cue. You WILL fall in love with Gregory Peck. He did such a fabulous job of portraying Atticus that I could not read the book without seeing his face. Can't remember the actress's name that played Scout, but she was perfect as well.]]></body>

It's short, I hope you get around to it Angela. ps: thanks!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Yeah, I knew I was seeking out a good friend when I requested your friendship. Of course, I am among the besotted where this novel is concerned. I highly recommend <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114408.Mockingbird_A_Portrait_of_Harper_Lee" title="Mockingbird A Portrait of Harper Lee by Charles J. Shields" rel="nofollow">Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9460.Charles_J__Shields" title="Charles J. Shields" rel="nofollow">Charles J. Shields</a>, an unauthorized biography. Ms. Lee dared friends to buy the book considering it an invasion of her privacy. However, this is a very respectful portrait of the reclusive author. There is also a new release I'll be checking out. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693728.The_Mockingbird_Next_Door_Life_with_Harper_Lee" title="The Mockingbird Next Door Life with Harper Lee by Marja Mills" rel="nofollow">The Mockingbird Next Door: Life with Harper Lee</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7353452.Marja_Mills" title="Marja Mills" rel="nofollow">Marja Mills</a>.<br /><br />Harper Lee based Atticus Finch on her father, Amasa Lee, a lawyer in small town Monroeville, Al. Harper Lee attended Huntington College in Montgomery, Al, the University of Alabama, and the University of Alabama School of Law. She graduated from none of them. Yet she received the necessary education from her father, her community, and her unerring sense of fairness, right and wrong.<br /><br />I've had occasion to visit the iconic courthouse portrayed in the movie. The curator allowed me to go downstairs and examine the records of the courts. Those records presented cases a hundred years ago that could easily be in any courtroom today.<br /><br />In each their own way the book and movie are among my favorites. The soundtrack makes excellent background music for reading the novel.<br /><br />To Lefty from Pancho (See All the Federales Say, Willie Nelson)]]></body>

Just so you know have been eyeballing your group for a while, so tempting - and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114408.Mockingbird_A_Portrait_of_Harper_Lee" title="Mockingbird A Portrait of Harper Lee by Charles J. Shields" rel="nofollow">Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee</a> looks great, thanks for that. Her connection with Capote also fascinates me (I'm a fan of both of them) which I'm sure is covered in this book. I'd love to tour that courthouse myself, with your professional background as a prosecutor that must have made that experience even more poignant, I'm really glad you experienced that.<br /><br />And Pancho? It's working for ya:)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hi Florence,<br /><br />The plot thickens. I have read that Harper Lee does suffer at this point with dementia. Later in the day, yesterday, after I posted that correction, I read another piece where her sister Alice---who practiced law until she was 100---stated that Harper Lee DID sign permission for the book but doesn't remember it now. This would be consistent with the uproar that arose in the last couple of years where Harper Lee also signed away the control of the To Kill A Mockingbird copyright to the son of her longtime (now deceased) literary agent. Then she sued him to regain control of the copyright based on the premise that she suffered from dementia and did not know what she was signing.<br /><br />Sad all around.<br /><br />Apparently her older sister Alice is much more lucid, even to this day. Based upon everything I've read since my last post in this thread, I'm inclined to deduce that Nelle Harper Lee probably agreed to participate in this upcoming book but has no memory of it. Alice states that her sister may not have understood the 2011 agreement she signed for this new book, since she suffered a stroke in 2007:<br /><br />"Poor Nelle Harper can't see and can't hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence. Now she has no memory of the incident, " Alice Lee wrote. <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.people.com/article/harper-lee-claims-marja-mills-memoir-unauthorized" rel="nofollow">http://www.people.com/article/harper-...</a><br /><br />And here is a fascinating piece about Alice Lee (a remarkable woman in her own right):<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/04/01/harper-lee-s-sister-alice-is-100-still-practices-law-and-remembers-everything.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles...</a><br /><br />________<br /><br />RT]]></body>

Her connection with Capote also fascinates me (I'm a fan of both of them) which I'm sure is covered in this book."</i><br /><br />I've always been intrigued with Ms. Lee's and Capote's relationship. It is covered well in "Mockingbird" and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/926177.Capote_A_Biography" title="Capote A Biography by Gerald Clarke" rel="nofollow">Capote: A Biography</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38368.Gerald_Clarke" title="Gerald Clarke" rel="nofollow">Gerald Clarke</a>. Although I found George Plimpton's bio entertaining. I recommend the Clarke.<br /><br />Amasa Lee gave an old typewriter to his daughter and Capote. They spent many hours composing stories in their childhood when Capote would be visiting his relatives the Faulks in Monroeville.<br /><br />Harper Lee was instrumental in being the point person in gaining Capote interviews for <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/168642.In_Cold_Blood" title="In Cold Blood by Truman Capote" rel="nofollow">In Cold Blood</a>. While writing what he considered his masterpiece, Harper Lee was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. Capote resented it. That he never won the Pulitzer was a factor that was always a burr under his saddle.<br /><br />The friendship between the two childhood friends began to unravel as a result of Capote's jealousy. He gave Lee no credit for her voluminous notes on interviews. He did not invite her to his famous "White Ball" after she won the Pulitzer. And, most petty, Capote began the rumor that he was the true author of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2657.To_Kill_a_Mockingbird" title="To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee" rel="nofollow">To Kill a Mockingbird</a>.<br /><br />Interestingly, long before Lee inserted Capote into her novel as Dill, Capote created a brash tomboyish character in his first novel <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2287.Other_Voices__Other_Rooms" title="Other Voices, Other Rooms by Truman Capote" rel="nofollow">Other Voices, Other Rooms</a> in 1948. The brash, immodest tomboy sounds as though she might be a more mature Scout.]]></body>
