  <description>Will Grayson meets Will Grayson. One cold night, in a most unlikely corner of Chicago, two strangers are about to cross paths. From that moment on, their world will collide and lives intertwine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not that far from Evanston to Naperville, but Chicago suburbanites Will Grayson and Will Grayson might as well live on different planets. When fate delivers them both to the same surprising crossroads, the Will Graysons find their lives overlapping and hurtling in new and unexpected directions. With a push from friends new and old - including the massive, and massively fabulous, Tiny Cooper, offensive lineman and musical theater auteur extraordinaire - Will and Will begin building toward respective romantic turns-of-heart and the epic production of history's most awesome high school musical.</description>

      <![CDATA[what do i say about <i>Will Grayson, Will Grayson</i> that hasn't already been said before? on one hand, i am well aware that this novel has its fair share of flaws. i'll be the first to admit that john green writes very formulaic characters, from his dorky male single-child protagonist to the manic pix...]]>

  <body><![CDATA[I was wondering what was up with your lowercase review... inspired by literature, I see.<br /><br />Wow, it's been so long since I read this book. I think I read it before I even reviewed the books I read. Honestly, all I remember was liking will grayson, reeeally not liking Tiny Cooper, and feeling a tad emotional over the Will/Tiny friendship. And then the whole thing went down the tubes for me when it turned into a Tiny Love-Fest at the end, since I didn't like him at all. But it's awesome that you connected with it. <br /><br />TL;DR - Not one of my favorite books. But I'm glad you liked it. :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thanks, Erin! Yup, I really wanted to see how hard it could be to write in all lower case and it was REALLY difficult. I'm that person who uses proper grammar and punctuation even when I type, so this review is kind of out there for me, but it was fun. <br /><br />I know a lot of people didn't completely connect with this book, but I think the messages in the end came through for me, especially the bit that I didn't need to understand what Will Grayson or Tiny Cooper or will grayson was going through, but just appreciate what they were doing. Plus, I'm a sucker for friendship novels and this was perfect for me. It isn't one of my favorite novels either and it definitely didn't come close to TFiOS, but I still really enjoyed and it's one of the best books I've read so far this year, so that counts for something!(:]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[oh my gosh, I LOVE this review. You made me want to read it all over again!<br /><br />One thing I never noticed that you mentioned: the fact that all of John Green's protagonists are only child(s). Are they? I'm trying to remember Paper Towns...I can't remember if that protag had a little brother/sister, but if he did, the sibling was basically nonexistent. I find this so so so interesting though because of the vlogbrothers videos. John clearly LOVES his brother and they are such close siblings, especially for their ages (since sadly, most siblings grow apart). So now I'm obsessed with finding out WHY Green has neglected to write about strong sibling relationships since his brother is one of the most important people in his life. <br /><br />So yeah, not really significant in terms of your review, but thanks for making me think of that. Super interesting. I actually really want to see more strong sibling relationships in YA because my siblings have always been my best friends.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thanks, Jill! :) I actually haven't read <i>An Abundance of Katherines</i> or <i>Paper Towns</i> yet, but I remember on one of the Question Tuesday Vlogbrothers Videos, someone asked John, so I assumed all his protagonists were only children from there. I know he DOES love his brother so much and they have such a great relationship, so I know he could write such an authentic sibling relationship perfectly. I hope he does, someday. :D]]></body>

First he jokingly said it was his subtle way of telling the world he didn't like/want Hank, but then he seriously said he just didn't know and hadn't felt like his characters needed siblings. *shrug*]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Mike, that is a GREAT question. I actually don't know. I know a lot of readers enjoyed <i>Every Day,</i> but I know for a fact that the lack of world-building would frustrate me, which is why I'm not picking that one up. Levithan's other novels seem interesting, but not so interesting that I'm really dying to read them. <i>The Lover's Dictionary,</i> for instance, sounds good but I picked it up in the library and wasn't impressed by the first few pages. Any recommendations of his? I do want to read more of his books, but the reviews seem to be so mixed and I tend to agree more with the negative reviewers than the positive ones. :/]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Most of the books I've read by him were actually his collaborations with Rachel Cohn, which doesn't count quite as much, although <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25373.Nick___Norah_s_Infinite_Playlist" title="Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist by Rachel Cohn" rel="nofollow">Nick Norah's Infinite Playlist</a> is definitely a worthwhile read.

It's about a few teenagers that witnessed 9/11. The storyline isn't particularly dramatic (which it shouldn't be), but there are some great characters and social commentary.]]></body>
