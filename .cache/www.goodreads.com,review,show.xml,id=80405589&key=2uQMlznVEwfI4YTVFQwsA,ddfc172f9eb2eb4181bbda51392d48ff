  <description>Harper Lee's Pulitzer prize-winning masterwork of honor and injustice in the deep southâ€”and the heroism of one man in the face of blind and violent hatred, available now for the first time as a digital audiobook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best-loved stories of all time, &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt; has been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than thirty million copies worldwide, served as the basis for an enormously popular motion picture, and was voted one of the best novels of the twentieth century by librarians across the country. A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father-a crusading local lawyer-risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[My grandmother would have said "Eleventy-seven" times. However, I would say a dozen or more. During my practice as a prosecuting attorney, I regularly returned to the book to remind me it was my job to do the right thing. I discovered the book around the seventh grade. It became one of my "summer" books, to which I turned in celebration of school being out for the summer. My first reads were childish. As an adult I have found more significant reasons to return to this novel time and again.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Florence (Lefty) wrote: "No, courage never goes out of style - loved this review, just saying:)"</i><br /><br />Thanks, Lefty. I love this novel. Interestingly, I've read articles that some school systems are removing the book from their curricula because the novel has become "dated" in the opinion of au courant school officials. Ironically, the book is just as frequently banned in more conservative school systems. To me the messages held in this novel are timeless and should always be encouraged reading material in any school.]]></body>

However, Atticus' integrity never goes out of style, nor does the need to defend and protect those who are the targets of community values. I can see the view that Atticus may seem paternalistic in today's society. My response will always be what hero would you put in his place?]]></body>

I especially remember Atticus' initial response that Jem might be due for an appearance in Juvenile Court, although he felt that he had a good case of self defense. I've always admired the sheriff's practical response: "Mr. Finch, I'm still Sheriff of Maycomb County and Bob Ewell fell on his knife."]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Howard, as much as I love To Kill A Mockingbird (and Flannery O'Connor), I suspect Flannery O'Connor would have been inclined to disagree with your addendum. Her literary worldview was, I think, tempered by her daily struggle and the trials in her life. Her work and her reality left little room for sentimentality. I don't think her craft and vision was ever very comfortable with the things that tugged at heartstrings. My take on that comment regarding Mockingbird was that she truly believed it belonged in the children's hour.]]></body>

Yes, I wanted to make this as hopeful as possible. And I think it was Harper Lee's intent to write about hope, even in the face of adversity and injustice. <br /><br />I have become jaded by our national leaders. I find it is all too often the conscience of an unsung individual whose actions spread further and with more consequence to meet the needs in the community either unseen or ignored by our Congress and Senate.<br /><br />That is why I hold out hope for all the Scouts and Jems to discover the hope presented by Harper Lee so that we might live in a more caring nation led by those who follow in our footsteps.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[As do I, Howard. We are of like mind on this. I disagree with her evaluation. I know she also avoided reading much by other contemporary Southern authors, like Faulkner, who wrote in the same neck of woods as she, to avoid too much cross-pollination. (I've held to the same practice as a writer.) So I've always suspected that Flannery O'Connor viewed a book like Mockingbird a bit askance and held at arm's length.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Matt, since reading Michelle Alexander's book, I've been looking on MLK <i>as</i> revolutionary. While Booker T. Washington advocated (and I'm sure I'm speaking very, very roughly) just being good according to accepted societal norms, MLK said that alone would never be enough to change things. It may be necessary but it is not sufficient. You and I may have different ideas about what is revolutionary. Possibly overthrowing the paradigm is most revolutionary of all. ...I know this is just a tease compared to your lengthy comment, but will leave it at that for now.]]></body>

The picture that we present of him in schools and civic discourse, however, is ..."</i><br /><br />Not long ago I saw Cornel West, in essence, make this very point when he cited the fact that MLK only had a forty percent approval rating within the black community at the time of his death. Time and canonization has a way of blurring the realities of the times. This is also true of artistic works, including literature. So many that are now revered were controversial or not popular in their day, because they were ahead of the curve and challenged the status quo.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Matt wrote: "I think before we judge O'Connor too harshly for her characterization of the book, it's important to look at a few things. (To preface: I really love TKaM, but I partially agree with O'Connor.) Why..."</i><br /><br />Matt, I don't think anyone has judged O'Connor harshly for her statement that TKAM is a children's book. You made some apt statements in your comment. However, I cannot agree with your statement "how sickly sweet and unbelievable Atticus' morality is, and how he's more of a fable or a 'hero for kids to emulate' than a real person."<br /><br />The fact of the matter is that I've known any number of "Atticus Finches" in my life. Circuit Judge Henry Holman Mize of Tuscaloosa County was an Alabama Legislator who was considered a likely candidate for Governor. He sponsored legislation to make it unlawful to wear a mask in a public assembly. In essence, in the early 1950s, Judge Mize unmasked the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama. After the impact of his legislation sank in, he received death threats at his family home. He never served another term in the legislature. And, of course, he never became Governor. His motivation for sponsoring the legislature was a raid by members of the Klan on a girl scout camp out in which both black and white children participated. The children were terrified.<br /><br />The Southern Law and Poverty Center bankrupted the Klan following the lynching of Michael Donald in Mobile, Alabama, in 1981. The Center was founded in 1971 by a white Jew named Morris Dees. Since its founding, Dees and his dedicated staff of young black and white attorneys established Klan Watch and now maintains a hate crimes watch.<br /><br />It is easy to reflect on earlier times and dismiss the efforts of individuals for being just a good person. However, change had to begin somewhere. And it began with individuals who recognized that "all men are created equal," and worked side by side with black Americans to see that they achieved that status as granted by our supposed Declaration of Independence.<br /><br />I also do not see Atticus Finch treating the black citizens of Maycomb County with condescension, but individuals entitled to equal protection under the law.<br /><br />Did Atticus not believe in what he sought defending Tom Robinson? I don't think so. I remember his imploring the jury, "For God's Sake do your duty!"<br /><br />Not to demean your comments, I must ask you if you lived through the Civil Rights Movement? I have seen the ridiculously unmasked Klan demonstrating outside a popular cafeteria to deter black citizens from eating there. I have been called a Nigger Lover for having black friends in highschool. And I must say many whites suffered the wrath of the Klan during the summer of the Freedom Riders and King's march from Selma to Montgomery.<br /><br />In closing I must say your comments concerning this novel are much in conflict with your five star rating if you find it a mere fable.<br /><br />In short it is much easier to talk the talk than walk the walk. You must know what times were like, you must know the price that was paid by so many individuals to bring about any form of equality in this country. <br /><br />No, I am not so naive to believe there no longer exists racism in this country. I believe it exists in every state of the Union and it exists in countries throughout the world sometimes simply on the basis of clan affiliation or religious belief.<br /><br />However, it is literature such as To Kill a Mockingbird and many other works from different lands that still offers hope for a better world. Such works are only fables when considered with cynicism.<br /><br />You are entitled to speak every word which you have written in your comment. However, perhaps your comments would be better made in a review written by you rather than mine.]]></body>

I sure hope that I am lucky enough someday to shake your hand.....I am speechless....almost....and for me that's very rare....your words in this last post hit me like a rock.....Perhaps you'd enjoy reading the biography CRONKITE by Douglas Brinkley......Uncle Walter was a lot like what you just said in your post....more than I realized,and it brought back the time of my growing up into adulthood, those memories, back into the forefront. I think it's one of the best books I've read so far this year......]]></body>

I remember his broadcast where he looked America in the face and said Vietnam could not be won. He was a remarkable journalist. I can't see myself anywhere near Cronkite. But I certainly take it as a compliment.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[You make this southern classic more than justice with this intimate review Mike. I should re-read Lee's masterpiece as I am afraid I was far too young and not ready to see the depth and real significance of this story. Added to my compulsory re-reads, maybe even before the year ends!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[You are so right about this book's attraction. It has become part of our psyche, and I am not even American. But like the Americans, this book's moral message has resonated all over the world. I cannot recall one single book-lover friend who have not read it. I listened to Sissy Spacek while following the text in the book. My eyes are not so good anymore and it was a delight to listened while I cooked. She did a marvelous job. Great review Mike. We have read this book simultaneously, it seems. I just finished the reread a few days ago.]]></body>

I have grown to appreciate this novel with each reading throughout my life. Although I was a career prosecutor, as opposed to a defense counsel for the greatest part of my career, my principles were guided by those of Atticus Finch. I believed and still believe that the court room is the great leveler where all men are created equal. I view the Ferguson affair with dismay and cannot escape the feeling that an injustice was allowed to occur by a District Attorney who just as surely led a grand jury to the finding of no indictment in the shooting of Michael Brown. It is why this novel continues to be as relevant today as it was in 1960.]]></body>

Normally, I do not consider an audio book a substitute for reading the novel. However, Sissy Spacek's rendering of this classic is a special treat. I highly recommend it. Had my wife and I not been driving it would have been wonderful to follow along with the novel in hand. So glad you enjoyed!]]></body>
