  <description>&lt;i&gt;There is an alternate cover edition &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25856606-the-fault-in-our-stars" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, then all at once."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the tumor-shrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis. But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel's story is about to be completely rewritten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insightful, bold, irreverent, and raw, The Fault in Our Stars is award-winning author John Green's most ambitious and heartbreaking work yet, brilliantly exploring the funny, thrilling, and tragic business of being alive and in love.</description>

I see your point on the "typical John Green novel" and can definitely respect that but he seems to have found a good formula for him. :)<br /><br />As always, I love to read your reviews! Thanks, Tatiana!<br /><br />Out of curiosity, what do you think JG's strongest work is?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I saw this at the bookstore this past weekend. I just about bought it too, without even reading the book's description first. Thankfully, at the last moment I did read the dust jacket and saw that this was a cancer book. A book about a couple of teenagers who have cancer. Falling in love for the first time in their lives (I'm guessing). While they're losing the battle with Cancer. Oh, the cruelty!<br /><br />Of course, in order for it to be a John Green novel, only one of them will die (the adorably quirky but unstable pixie girl?)<br /><br />I set that baby back on the shelf and walked away. I was like <i>hello, John Green, it's been done a billion other times already! And I think a good rule of thumb for authors should be, if it seems like something Nicholas Sparks would write, don't do it.</i><br /><br />Great review as always, Tatiana.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Tatiana, you should get an award or something for the help you give us your friends with books. I knew I should hold off reading this when all the five star reviews started popping up. Contrary to others, I'm always suspicious of books that rack up a bunch of five star reviews. <br /><br />Anyway, Kat was right. Your reviews are indeed brilliant. You've developed a special expertise at this that you dont have to write a 500 word review to get your point across. <br />It would be so wonderful if you started a review blog!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[To me, adding cancer to a book that is not a true-life nonfic is like having your villain running around literally stealing lollipops from babies and kicking puppies. It takes a helluva writer to pull that off, and it has to be someone who won't be suckered into pushing the easy emo buttons. I haven't read this book, but I don't expect I will, because I am *that* reluctant to read a book that uses such an easy emotional gut punch for its premise. He could do a great job with it, but I'd need skeptical people similar to myself to tell me that before I picked it up, and you're telling me otherwise. Thanks for the review -- you're not the only one who feels this way about tricky, emotionally manipulative topics like this one.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Good review, I pretty much had the same issues. About 1/3 of the way in I thought it might be his best, but it lapsed into his typical plot line, as you said it was a bit Lifetime-y, and the dialogue almost became overwhelming for me in its lack of any sort of realism. I don't have a problem suspending disbelief when necessary, but I don't think this is the type of book where one should need to do that.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thank-you! You confirmed my suspicions. I am a little surprised he decided to use the John Green Formula in this one, too. I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6567017.Will_Grayson__Will_Grayson" title="Will Grayson, Will Grayson by John Green" rel="nofollow">Will Grayson, Will Grayson</a> and loved it. So, I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99561.Looking_for_Alaska" title="Looking for Alaska by John Green" rel="nofollow">Looking for Alaska</a>and<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2914097.Paper_Towns" title="Paper Towns by John Green" rel="nofollow">Paper Towns</a>, then I tried <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49750.An_Abundance_of_Katherines" title="An Abundance of Katherines by John Green" rel="nofollow">An Abundance of Katherines</a>and quit. How many times can he write the same story and get paid for it? He's young and just starting his career; with any luck, he'll get out of this plot template rut, or he'll collaborate with John Leviathan again (oddly, I don't particularly like either of their solo work, but when they come together, I love it).<br /><br />Great review!]]></body>

Both are okay enough, but nothing that extraordinary. What surprised (and kinda irritated--if that is even the proper word for what I felt--me) was when reading "Let It Snow", the plot, characters, road trip felt as if it had been ripped straight out of "Paper Towns". I admire his ability to make smart characters, but if each story is basically going to be about Quentin/Margo/Funny sidekick, I'm done.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Good review. I'm still trying to figure out what my star rating is going to be on this one. (That's the fault in MY stars, ha ha.) <br /><br />I agree with the comment above that "the first John Green Book you read is the best one." For me that was PAPER TOWNS. Since, they've just dropped off, and I think it is because they are the same book. <br /><br />Formula can be great--I will totally own up to liking a lot of John Grisham--but it gets staid after a while, and I agree--this one felt so <i>intentional</i>. I could see the hand over the marionette and that wasn't fun.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Have you ever seen any of John Green's videos on YouTube? I feel like I'm always biased when it comes to John Green's work because I admire him and his enthusiasm so much (something I see in his videos mostly). But as fan of John Green, I can see that he's not the best author by miles and his work is very formulaic. He actually made a blog post on tumblr acknowledging that his themes do get repetitive. I just wonder why he doesn't push himself as an author if he recognises some of his flaws, because I really do admire him as a person.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[The only John Green I've read was <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49750.An_Abundance_of_Katherines" title="An Abundance of Katherines by John Green" rel="nofollow">An Abundance of Katherines</a>, and I just wasn't super impressed. It had some funny dialogue and a few quirky characters (I mean, really? You can only date girls named Katherine spelled with a K??), but I wondered if I had maybe just picked the wrong JG book to start out with. Now I wonder if I'd love any of them since so many agree they are incredibly similar.<br /><br />Great review, Tatiana!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I think a big reason why a lot of people are praising this (specifically Nerdfighters) is because it hits home with the nerdfighter community (I don't know if you are a watcher of John's videos on YouTube) with the influence that Esther Earl (she died of Hazel's cancer at sixteen) had on the community. He worked as a Chaplin at a children's hospital for five months which is why he originally started writing a cancer story. <br />And I, for one, will never get tired of John Green humor. :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[John Green worked as a hospital chaplain for a brief period of time when he was 22. He's essentially been trying to write this novel since then. It's less about the actual cancer, and more about its effect on those who have it. It focuses on the characters coming to terms with imminent tragedy, not the tragedy of cancer.]]></body>

His biography shouldn't affect what you take away from the book itself, and I was simply stating something that answers your question that regard's author's intent. When you ask a question in regard's to the author's intent, it generally will use some sort of biographical data/information/motive.<br /><br />And, I believe you are misinterpreting what I was saying.

  <body><![CDATA[Seems that you were so wrapped up in the fact that it was a "cancer book" To me it seems you didnt really understand most of what the book was saying. The cancer was a prop, a device, to describe what its like to but not dead but not really alive either. Did the themes of some infinities are greater than others, and the universe being noticed and noticing the universe, and many more go over your head? It seems like you maybe have read too many books to give this one a fair review. Its like the movie critic who has seen about every movie ever made that hates or undermines ALL new movies because it didnt "add anything new" This is exactly why john green writes for teenagers because he knows people like you probably have become numb to the passionate themes that are important to learning about yourself and growing up. To me, this was the most touching, funny, smart, simultaneously real and surreal book i have ever read. But you know what? I havent read a thousand books either. But i'm glad that I am the type of person to be blown away by this type of book, or any book for that matter.]]></body>
