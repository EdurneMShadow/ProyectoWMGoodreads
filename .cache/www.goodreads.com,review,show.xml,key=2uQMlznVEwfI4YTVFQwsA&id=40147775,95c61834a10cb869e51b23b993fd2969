  <description>This deluxe collector's edition of Tolkien's modern classic is boxed and bound in green leatherette with gold and red foil rune stamping on the spine and cover. The text pages are printed in black with green accents. It includes five full page illustrations in full color and many more in two color in addition to Thror's map—all prepared by the author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien's own description for the original edition: "If you care for journeys there and back, out of the comfortable Western world, over the edge of the Wild, and home again, and can take an interest in a humble hero (blessed with a little wisdom and a little courage and considerable good luck), here is a record of such a journey and such a traveler. The period is the ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men, when the famous forest of Mirkwood was still standing, and the mountains were full of danger. In following the path of this humble adventurer, you will learn by the way (as he did)—if you do not already know all about these things—much about trolls, goblins, dwarves, and elves, and get some glimpses into the history and politics of a neglected but important period. For Mr. Bilbo Baggins visited various notable persons; conversed with the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent; and was present, rather unwillingly, at the Battle of the Five Armies. This is all the more remarkable, since he was a hobbit. Hobbits have hitherto been passed over in history and legend, perhaps because they as a rule preferred comfort to excitement. But this account, based on his personal memoirs, of the one exciting year in the otherwise quiet life of Mr. Baggins will give you a fair idea of the estimable people now (it is said) becoming rather rare. They do not like noise."</description>

  <body><![CDATA[The Hobbit has been one of my favorites since I saw the 70s cartoon version back when I was about 5 years old, so I've looked forward to the LotR movies as well as this one. I really enjoyed this latest Hobbit movie, but it definitely didn't need to be almost 3 hours long, especially not if there are two more movies to follow. And I while I did get a little irritated when it stretched into Disney/Pixar territory with its silliness, specifically the Radagast scenes, I had to remind myself that Tolkien wrote this as a bedtime story for his children at a time when fantasy didn't go much further beyond fable. So by the second hour I gave in and enjoyed Jackson's version for what it is....and in a few hours I'm going back to see it again but in 3D!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I love this book. I like it better than LotR actually. I just love Bilbo. Read it again before seeing the movie this week. Yesterday actually. And I loved both. Differently. There were small parts of the movie I could have done without. But the rest were perfect. To me. And I thought the casting was wonderful. Bilbo is officially Martin Freeman (Watson) to me. Love or hate it though. Or between. One thing watchers are not thinking of. Or maybe they are. But Old-Bilbo is writing the story down for Frodo. That's why it's different from LotR. I do worry about the 3 movie thing. But if they're this good? Bring them. <br />The only bad? Waiting.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[To me, this book isn't about the Hobbit, but about the dwarves. They have always been my favorite characters. So, I knew going in, if they weren't right, then I wouldn't like the movie. I friggin loved the movie. The dwarven characters were awesome, especially Thorin Oakenshield and the twins, Fili and Kili. <br /> I was not surprised Mr Jackson decided to turn this great novel into two movies. But, was slightly taken aback trying to figure from which orifice he would pull all the additional info to carry this into three movies. After watching movie one, I anxiously await 2 and 3. Mr Jackson can gladly pull from whatever orifice he would like as long as he continues to honor this work and do it so marvelously.]]></body>

Jackson's done a great job in turning more attention to developing and displaying the dwarves, something often overlooked in reading Tolkien.]]></body>

The book has always been about Bilbo front and center and the dwarves sort of in the back. A little overlooked. The movie I loved the dwarves! I had heard going into the movie that Jackson added a lot of unneeded humor. And of course I knew the book also has its moments. So I was a little nervous. But I thought how Jackson handled the dwarves was awesome. The humor was there sure. But he gave them honor and pride too. Not just greed and stubborness. And I actually enjoyed Richard Armitage's Thorin more than Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn. (Not to mention as a female viewer, he was very easy on the eyes...don't think I have ever said that about a dwarf. Lol.)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I have always been with Traci, the focus being on Bilbo, but I really enjoyed the focus on the dwarves in this movie. I have to say, Gimli is probably one of the best, if not THE best, character in the Lord of the Rings and I completely support this emphasis.<br /><br />Especially those first few scenes in the movie, the dwarven halls beneath the mountain, even the king's beard - for some reason that really stuck with me. Loved it from the beginning.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA["The Hobbit delivers with orc-slaying, adventure-having, rock-throwing, breath-taking goodness. What's wrong with that?"<br /><br />Everything. The movies reveal not only that Peter Jackson hates Tolkien's works, but that he knows he hates Tolkien's works and wishes to do violence to them and make immitations of them in corrupted mockery of the real thing. It's not that there are changes and deviations here and there, it's that the particular changes and deviations under taken by the writer have a coherent theme and a purpose and it is a coherent theme and purpose which stands in opposition to that of the books.]]></body>

I've read The Hobbit about 5 to 10 times (three times in the last 5 years and however many as a kid) and The Lord of the Rings 4 times at least. I've never thought that the movies 'destroyed' the elements of Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit that were in there. They just emphasised the action elements already in the books. Really, if we were to turn the books into what Tolkien was after we'd end up with a linguistics movie set in Middle Earth :p]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I couldn't disagree more. It's not just about expectations. There really was no reason to alter it this greatly, first of all. The story Jackson adds is irrelevant and Tolkien only included in LOTR appendices for good reason. Jackson only extended it to make money; otherwise, much of the storyline had no purpose (including Galadriel - whom they just added for star power - and Radagast - who just detracted from the main story). Not knowing the greater story was part of the original magic. Great story telling involves leaving out more than it does piling on. Less is more as a matter of principle, and Jackson just adds irrelevant material. Worse, I at no time actually thought the Dwarves were in jeopardy, which means I could care less about the outcome. Of course, the main characters would live (I've read the book) but an audience HAS to believe its possible someone could die. Jackson uses CGI (eye candy) so much it defies the laws of physics! Middle Earth may have some magic to it, but Tolkien was restrained in his use of supernatural elements; the Dwarves were subject to the same laws of physics as the rest of us. They can't drift from rock to rock or Goblin-made bridge, whatever it was, as the mountain falls apart around them without even a scrape on them! It's more than stupid. It's insulting, particularly to Tolkien himself. It was made for a 14 year old who likes visuals more than story. Typical Hollywood garbage that crowds out story in favor of special effects. There are movies (very rare these days) that manage to give story AND special effects in the proper balance. This is not one of those.]]></body>

This was a childhood book for me and coming back I recognise that one of the major flaws was its overall disconnect from the bigger story. Tolkien himself edited The Hobbit to fit into Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion, leaving hints which fed into that story. I just see Jackson as doing that. I respect anyone who disagrees and doesn't see balance but I did. Anything which was added was from within the world of Lord of the Rings itself so it's not destroying the logic of the world but I thought it actually strengthened (or at least attempted to) the flaws. I will say that they really haven't done a lot to fix the lack of females but I'm thinking the flaws will be resolved in the overall 'trilogy'.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I believe those weren't flaws in the original book but part of it. The reader was only told as much as needed for the main narrative of the book and nothing more. Once the reader gets to LOTR he or she needs a larger story and now is told the significance of the ring and not before. Even LOTR wasn't large enough to tell the entire story, so appendices were included. The Silmarillion was actually written first but was initially refused publication because it was too dark; I'm sure it was eventually edited to make room for new material from the Hobbit and LOTR. I'm willing to accept some sort of larger story to fit it into the LOTR universe. But the problem is Jackson does it very ineptly. A story should flow and be consistent and this one doesn't. It jumps from point to point haphazardly, jarring the reader out of one storyline, jamming him into another and then back again without so much as a how-do-you-do. It's like bad sex. Jackson (and the studio) knew it would make a bunch of money so very little effort was put into this screenplay. Jackson should go back to making movies like Heavenly Creatures. It suffers from the exact same problems as Episodes I, II and III of the Star Wars saga, horrible storytelling and a reliance on special effects to wow the audience. But then again, George Lucas isn't bad company, I suppose.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Jonathan wrote: "Well personally I did feel for the most part that it did flow, although I recognise a lack of consistency.

A little too much in love with CGI without acknowledging its limitations. I was disappointed in the Fellowship when it first came out, but upgraded my opinion when I bought the Director's Cut, which added material, enhancing my experience. And the films got better each time, for me. I hope the Hobbit movies do the same but I'm not holding my breath. I just take any chance I can get to gripe about CGI. Robert Redford said Star Wars (a great movie, btw) was the death of storytelling and he was right. Special effects has officially taken over the narrative.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Ah, I see, I have no issue with CGI when there's stories as well. I in fact love lots of CGI when it's used well and thought it was fine in The Hobbit. I don't really see why a lot of people have always thought VFX is cheating (as they said for the original Tron, denying it an oscar for that reason). But when something feels too glassy or rather glossy, like it's using VFX as a screen (think Transformers) I'll enjoy it but not like it. I still caught the warmth from this and liked it a lot more than King Kong. Jackson tried turning a simple, non-epic into a real epic.]]></body>
