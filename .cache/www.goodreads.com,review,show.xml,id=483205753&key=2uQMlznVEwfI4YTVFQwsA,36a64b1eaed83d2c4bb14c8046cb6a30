  <description>Every few decades a book is published that changes the lives of its readers forever. Paulo Coelho's &lt;i&gt; The Alchemist &lt;/i&gt; is such a book With over a million and a half copies sold in Latin America and Europe, &lt;i&gt; The Alchemist &lt;/i&gt; has already achieved the status of a modern classic. Now this charming fable has been translated into English to enchant and inspire an even wider audience for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the magical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure as extravagant as any ever found. From his home in Spain he journeys to the markets of Tangiers into the Egyptian desert where a fateful encounter with the alchemist awaits him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a story that teaches us, as only few stories can, about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, learning to read the omens strewn along life's path and, above, all follow our dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Paulo Coelho... has attained the technical levels of a Saint-Exupery or a Richard Bach."&lt;/i&gt; - Folha da Sao Paulo</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Well since you haven't read it yet, it would be a spoiler if I tell you. Which may change your perception about the book. But I at least I can say, without spoiling, that book had a flow but some how couldn't maintain it at many places, it was random, I felt. And the writing was not, you know, at par with other books I've read (well its a translation in English, but a mediocre one). <br /><br />The characters never had any psychology, I never knew how the character is building inside the novel. They were just behind something, and that's it. The novel couldn't hook my attention for long, it was boring sometimes too. I wanted to like the book, because it actually have some real insights towards life, but I couldn't like it. It was the story that was not up to the mark for me. Not enough detail, only superficial details were provided. And it felt like that the author never actually wanted to write this novel except to convey a meaning. Which he actually did, at the expense of not-detailed, a little dry, story. <br />All that I could like the best about the book I've written in review. That's the best part. And, in my opinion, give this book a shot, one can at learn something from it.]]></body>

And you know I've been quite generous that I've given this poorly written book two stars. I could've given it one star but only for that shitty message I've given it two stars. <br /><br />p.s: If you think this book is very good and I didn't understand it, then you are ignorant of the rich literature that exists in the world.]]></body>

This book is overrated and overhyped. But here in India I've seen it is actually a favortie book among those who don't read (people who have read just 4 or 5 books in their whole life, including prescribed school novels). But, of course, it's not all bad; it does contain something worthwhile - some basic ideas and some motivation.]]></body>

And one more point most of the new-age-pop books (such as Chetan Bhagat and others in India) are favorites among non-readers.

I have read self - help books. It is not my favorite genre but I try to read a variety of books. I did read The Secret ~ which was no secret after all. I realize that the NA movement takes from different disciplines and re-packages them. But, if the message gets across to the masses regardless of their intellectual level, don't you think it has accomplished its purpose?. I have known of people whose life has changed reading certain books.<br />:P]]></body>

There were two types of quotes - <br />1). Which I understood and were helpful, in some sense, to me.<br />2). Which were cliched (and probably meaningless) and not useful; and there were hell lot of it. <br /><br />The most famous one was: "And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it". It was something that I could relate it with considering my psychological condition at the time. It at least provides some comfort to helpless people, and above all to procrastinators.<br /><br />Other quote was related to Truth. It was something like this: if you speak the naked truth no one would believe you, but if you speak a lie, sugar coating it, such that it sounds true, people will believe it.<br /><br />This one was somewhat reassuring : "Don't give in to your fears. If you do, you won't be able to talk to your heart."<br /><br />And one more, though cliched: “The secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times.”<br /><br />p.s: I guess, all the above mentioned quotes can be pretentious, too, at the same time as being useful.]]></body>

I have known of people whose life has changed reading certain books."</i><br /><br />True, but I agree with you partly. It does help the masses in some way or the other. But in my case I'd already read some great parables before reading this book. And this book in its entirety was not that great comparing with other books that I had read previously. <br /><br />I do not regard Cohello a fiction writer, but rather a spiritual guru who writes parables and stories, not to amuse but to enlighten. And it is here that I find Cohello far behind the gurus such as Osho, J Krishnamurthi, Huxley, Herman Hesse; and I've already read those guys before Cohello. So it's like: when you had already tasted something sweeter anything less sweeter would be tasteless. Same is the case with Cohello with me, because I'd already tasted something sweeter before reading him. <br /><br />On a different note: First impression is the last impression. For those people who claim that Cohello have changed their life, he must have been the first-of-its-kind author that those people have read. So it makes sense that they like him.]]></body>
