  <description>&lt;b&gt;About three things I was absolutely positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Edward was a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there was a part of him—and I didn't know how dominant that part might be—that thirsted for my blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first book of the Twilight Saga, internationally bestselling author Stephenie Meyer introduces Bella Swan and Edward Cullen, a pair of star-crossed lovers whose forbidden relationship ripens against the backdrop of small-town suspicion and a mysterious coven of vampires. This is a love story with bite.</description>

My three-star rating is the median of the three:<br /><br /><i>Review 1, by My Inner Fifteen Year Old Girl (5 stars):</i><br />Bella is smart, funny, well-read, pretty and yet misunderstood by most of her peers (just like me).

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with your inner feminist. It's like from the moment she starts "falling" for Edward, she stops being an intelligent and independent young woman and starts behaving like a pathetic and childish fangirl. It's not exactly the most endearing story in relation to how girls are expected to behave while in love or even for the sake of love.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Very interesting! A teacher friend of mine said she couldn't put it down, read it in one day (She is a fast reader. I don't doubt she got everything too cause she is smart! Plus she will be tutoring a girl with it so she pays attention to things to discuss later) Anyway, I wanted to hear what others thought before I got interested in it. Thanks for your detailed review. I like how you looked at it from different perspectives. Still unsure if I'll read it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Funny -- I'm a teacher, too. In fact, the only reason I picked it up was that one of my favorite sophomores loved it and was passing it around to all her friends (who pretty much make up the newspaper staff, which I advise). I eventually asked to read it so I could keep up with their conversations. As my review indicates, I didn't exactly love it, but I can also see its appeal to (certain) teenage girls. Much to their disappointment I couldn't bring myself to read the others; instead, I lent Cristina the first season of Buffy on DVD and got her hooked on a vampire story where the main character is a strong, kick-ass fighter, rather than the weak, limpid Bella.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[wonderful review! Spot on! After reading half the first and then moving on to the second i couldn't get through it. I found it very predictable and cliche. For a book to be appealing to teen girls all you need to add it some romance, supernatural, mean villain and some 'danger'. Usually I love these kind of books! I'm only a teenage girl and I loathed this story. Bella was a strong girl in the beginning till she fell for Edward and became weak and dependent on him! It's what a teenaged girl (but not me) wants to hear. A Faery Tale.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I'll ditto Willa. Protagonists (male and female) in young adult lit play double roles -- first as interesting characters and second as role models. The second role isn't necessary in literature that is not aimed squarely at a teen audience, alowing an author to have weak/abusive/greedy characters as much as they want.<br /><br />The same does hold true for male characters -- I expect the men in YA lit to be role models as well, in ways I don't expect it of men in non YA lit. <em>Lolita</em> is one of my favorite novels, but for obvious reasons I would object to a YA novel whose main character was a sexual predator. <br /><br />Bella's largest literary crime, however, is that she also fails in the first role -- she is not an interesting character. She is a flat, helpless character who inspires less compassion and empathy than pitty.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This novel is a straight-out romance first and a YA second. That Bella is uninteresting and dull isn't a flaw in a romance, it's just part of the territory. Edward loves her despite how passive and boring she is. Kind of what every girl reader longs for--no need to act; love will come find you. But for the rest of us ... ho-hum.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Toni: Yes, I would absolutely ask the same thing of male characters. Weakness can make for compelling drama. Do you watch Battlestar Galactica? Gaius Baltar gives into his weaknesses constantly.<br /><br />But as Chris alludes to, there is a difference between weak and flat/lifeless. I haven't read the book yet, but as he described Bella, I too would be bored by a character who was flat/lifeless. After reading the first 2 Harry Potter books, I gave up on them for just that reason. I didn't find Harry to be an interesting character.<br /><br />Willa, Chris: I know very little about the psychology of pre-teeens and teens who read YA fiction, but I'm not quite convinced that they seek to emulate characters they find entertaining in fiction. And even if they do, I'm sure most kids are perfectly able to be entertained but filter out the negative examples. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree that most kids are able to filter out negative examples -- that's why I've never told my vamp-obsessed students not to read these books, and in fact have encouraged their enthusiastic reading of volume after volume. Lord knows when I was their age I adored and devoured everything by David Eddings, which is just as juvenile and badly written (plus contains some of the most anti-Arabic xenophobia disguised as fantasy I've ever read, and I survived that terrible influence). My personal preference is for interesting YA characters that, though not perfect, can in some way act as a role model.<br /><br />And although my kids don't emulate everyone they see in fiction and can filter out negative examples, our sense of personal identity <em>is</em> shaped by the portrayals we see around it -- both in real life and in all forms of media. I teach in the South Bronx, and this is especially true for my students. Black and Latino teens are constantly given negative stereotypes of themselves, and the young women get it twice as bad, as they also grow up with all the negative images of women that our society perpetuates. While I know that one mediocre vamp-romance won't suddenly brain-wash them, I think that the "passive/weak woman who needs to be saved" is one of the more pervasive and dangerous stereotypes that entertainment media teachers. Is it an actual fantasy that (some) women have? Of course. But like other pornography, I think its better aimed at an adults who already have a healthy idea of what an actual mature relationship is. <br /><br />Will it kill them? No. Like I said, I actual encourage them to get the newest books. I wish they'd read something a bit better written and with better characters, so I encourage them to watch Buffy (and read the new comics, which rock!), and read such books as Sabriel, the truth about Smek Day, Speak, and anything by Bloor.<br />]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Do all female characters have to be strong? Do all male characters have to be strong?<br /><br />All people aren't heroes/heroines, and most have strengths and weaknesses. I think it would be sad if every book character had to be.<br /><br />There are also many types of strength, and even though Bella is not on my list of favorite heroines, she shows strength a lot during the book. She shows bravery, self-sacrifice and kindness; she makes and stands by her own decisions regardless of what others think. She is imperfect and has weaknesses, but I am so glad she isn't the ideal feminist heroine. She is seventeen, and I don't know any seventeen year old strong, ideal feminists who are always completely rational.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[The funny thing is that I didn't like the book that much at all. I thought the writing was mediocre and the story line was unoriginal. I was really bothered by a lot of the romance, because it seemed so over the top.<br /><br />But for some reason, the objections you have raised don't bother me at all. I never thought for a minute that Bella only liked him because he was hot. I thought that they liked each other because they were fated to. He has lived ninety years and never fallen in love, she has been chased by a lot of other guys and said no because she wasn't looking for someone to date. When love comes so strongly and unexpectedly (and I am, to the bitter end, a hopeless romantic) this is the kind of story you get. The story of two people who are silly, irrational and obsessed. <br /><br />Anyway, like I said, Twilight wasn't the greatest book ever written, and the characters are silly. But I have problems with the idea that Bella and Edward, because they are the heroes of the book, have to live up to some standard of strength and perfection. They don't. They can be wimpy, childish, or even out of their minds, because people (even teenagers) are.<br /><br />I think it is funny that people are saying "He's no Edward." When I was in high school, they were saying "He's no Mr. Darcy." ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[i do agree with that. but unlike you two, i don't have any experiance with love like that. i am only 14. but i think the reason i don't like those books are becase i don't like the main character. its kind of hard to enjoy a book when you don't like the person the view is coming from. <br /><br />mr. darcy was interesting.(i have read pride and predijuce.) but bella isn't. and edward is at times but not realy.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hey great review! I completely and toatally agree with you. I have a love/hate rea;ationship going with the Stephanie Meyer books. However I have read all four of the twilight saga books. I was hooked from page one of Twilight, but felt that the way Bella depended so completely on Edward was pathetic and sad. When he left in book 2 and Jacob was in the picture, I liked it. It was more healthy for Bella to have an existance outside of Edward Cullen.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Your review definitely helps make sense of the wildly conflicting opinions I've seen of this book. (bet it does depend on your reader hat) All of my writer friends say it sucks (the prose style, imagery, dialogue, characters etc. are wholly unoriginal/dull, and I agree with this from having read the first chapter) and that the book basically makes no sense, but then at Thanksgiving I was overwhelmed with people fervently recommending it because the writing was so good, the plot was fantastic, characterization rocked etc. (of course, none of them were writers). So in short, great review. Now at least I don't have to feel compelled to suffer through the rest of it. ]]></body>
