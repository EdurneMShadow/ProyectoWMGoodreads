  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

I will though, but it's not out here for another month-6weeks.<br />Is your review spoilerish? I will read it now if it's not... but I don't know if I want to read the spoilers...<br /><br />I am hoping Mockinjay is not a let down too. I could end very badly I think. Someone's got to die don't they? ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I actually think the cover and title is suitable. I mean, the Mocking Jay IS the symbol in the whole story...? Anyway, it's the last book and the title has always had something to do with the story in the past, so maybe its about the mockingjay somehow. I abosolutly love this trilogy and I could care less about the cover. I cant wait for it to come out. Bring on the action!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[FULL OF SPOILERS!!!<br /><br /><br /><br />Two stars? What!? <br /><br />Okay, so while I'm shocked that you didn't like this book, I respect your opinion. When I finished it, I thought, "WOW!" Then I thought, "this book is going to piss a lot of people off". <br /><br />You're right, Katniss doesn't ever really become the Mocking Jay, but in my opinion, she wasn't Mocking Jay material. She never wanted to be. That's why she never quite became what district thirteen wanted her to be. But, in the end, she did what she felt was the right thing to do, and I can't say I disagree with what she did. <br /><br />The new President was as much a tyrant as President Snow, if not more so, because she was claimed to be different from what he was. And she wasn't. She didn't want a better life for her people, she wanted more power, pure and simple. <br /><br />When it comes to the unfortunate death of Primrose, well, I can't say that I was shocked. Suzanne Collins isn't afraid to do what most authors are, kill off favorite characters. <br /><br />Some might say that Primrose might as well have died in the arena. In fact, I think Katniss did think that--I'll have to reread the book because I read the book so fast that I already forgot some of the finer details. But I think by repeating the words to the song The Hanging Tree, and having Katniss think about the meaning, Suzanne Collins is trying to get us to ask ourselves the same questions. <br /><br />I've gone a little further and asked myself, if Prim hadn't died like that, would Katniss have followed through and killed President Snow? Would killing him have made up for all he'd done to Katniss, not to mention countless others? What would have happened under the rule of President Coin (I listened to the audiobook so I don't know if it's spelled different)? I don't know, like I said, I think she did the right thing. <br /><br />And President Snow died anyway, so I have no complaints, although he didn't have TB. He had some sort of chronic condition that gave him mouth sores, because he drank poison that was meant to kill someone who stood in his way. That's why his breath always reeked of blood. That's why his lips were so puffy. <br /><br />She didn't pick Peeta because he came back, she chose him because he's who she needed to survive, like Gale said. Peeta isn't just the boy with the bread, he's the dandelion she saw that day on the playground. <br /><br />Plus, Katniss was never really a romantic at heart, though I could tell throughout this book and most of Catching Fire that she loved him.<br /><br />And anyway, Gale's right, she would always wonder if the bombs used to kill Prim were his invention. Which, I'm sorry, when he was talking about it earlier on in the book, I was disgusted. I was sad that he felt the need to stoop to President Snow's level in order to fight back.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Katniss did say she loved him...it definitely wasn't romantic or anything, but I wasn't expecting much from Katniss. She wasn't exactly the warm and fuzzy touchy feely type. I mean, I love Peeta and sort of agree that he deserves better--but I've hated Katniss since book one. Just something about her, I don't know. <br /><br />And I agree about the pointless deaths. I felt like she put them in there because she didn't want to have to kill either Gale or Peeta, so she figured she'd have to kill a bunch of the other likable secondaries. Finnick :( :( I was really upset about that! He was the only light in this book for me, and then he had to die in that awful way. So annoying. I kind of wish now that I'd never read this. I want to pretend it doesn't exist and make up my own ending.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with the review, but enjoyed the book. I am annoyed that anything good that happened in this book were in such small doses, almost to the point where I wanted to put it down. Peeta never seemed to get 100% better.. or even 80% back to himself. He was just so matter of fact about everything.. so robot like. I am sad that we didn't see the warm "loving" side to him at all in this book. The deaths weren't even descriptive... they just.. happened. The ending was mostly on stupid Katniss's emotional state. If Peeta was really back to normal (or mostly back to normal) he would have been there helping her get through all of this, not just living next door minding his business. EH.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Penny, I'll have to agree to disagree with your points, I think you are giving Katniss entirely too much credit. She most certainly would have killed Snow, it was the only thing she seemed willing to get out of bed for. The only agenda she appeared to care about and I have to agree with Krista that Collins killed other characters because she couldn't bring herself to kill Peeta, Gale or Katniss. I thoought the way Collins slaughtered Peeta's character was a travesty, but the biggest travesty was the way she crafted Katniss. She wasn't even a glimmer of the girl we saw in the arena and I can't help but wander if the other characters in the story would have supported such a sham of a girl had they known how weak in character she truly was?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I also have to disagree that Katniss did what she felt was right. IMO, she killed Coin because Coin killed Primm, plain and simple. Katniss spends the entire book being dictated to by district 13 and while she chafes at it, she doesn't really do anything about it. Had Coin not have been the cause of Primm's demise, I doubt very highly that Katniss would have been the cause of her's. Instead, Katniss would have aimed that arrow straight for snow. Katniss is blind to anything that doesn't effect her directly.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[You just read my mind - seriously. I thought the exact thing about Katniss... she became whiny and self absorbed in Mockingjay<br />In the Hunger Games and even Catching Fire she showed herself as being resourceful, smart and brave and I expected her to use these qualities to lead the rebellion or at least help it along! <br />And I also agree with what you said about what happened to Peeta - completely unnecessary. <br />And Finnick dying? Just after he married Annie? I mean common, completely pointless. <br />This book was just... ugh.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[That's what I've been trying to say. I feel like by not loving this book, I'm saying that I don't like books to be more realistic or that I can't handle it, when that's not it at all. I keep going back to the Hunger Games and asking myself what was different because that one was just as gruesome. But the way Collins delivered the story isn't. I feel like she's calling me out for liking a story that's so horrific when the only reason I did is because she made it fascinating. She made me care about the characters. None of the characters showed up for this book and without strong characters and good character development, all you have are some cruel sequences of war that mean nothing. Everyone applauds her for not being afraid to kill off characters or be cruel to them, but there's a difference between not sheltering your characters in giving them what the story requires and destroying your characters beyond reasonable expectation. You can go to the extreme the other way.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, you should put a spoiler warning on your review.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I came on here to express my disappointment for the Mockingjay, but saw your review first. Your summary is dead on, and I couldn't voice my opinion any better.<br /><br />Throughout this book, I felt as if the author had handed her pen over to a 10 year old with ADD - the descriptions were choppy and all over the place, and she never seemed to stay on a subject long enough to quite get a visualization or a real feel for what was going on - notably once the team had begun the trek to the capital.<br /><br />Katniss had such fire and passion in the beginning of the trilogy, but Suzanne Collins wrapped up the final pages with no emotion and lacking depth. It just makes you wish both Peeta and Katniss had died fighting for the rebellion - at least this would have given their characters a chance to remain memorable.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I loved your review. Well thought-out and on point. Collins completely betrayed the reader in MJ. She set you up for a revolution, but Katniss was no revolutionary. I liked that Coin was evil; many revolutions end by putting worse or just different despots in charge. But, there is hope for humanity, is there not? Apparently not in Collins' world. She took the characters with the most humanity and stripped it of them (Peeta, Finnick, Primm) by killing them off or, in Peeta's case, torturing them. And Katniss ends the book as more of a pawn than when she started HG.<br /><br />Badly done, Collins.]]></body>
