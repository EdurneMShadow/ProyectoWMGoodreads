  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?</description>

      <![CDATA[The first person narrative meant being in the thoughts of 2 very sick people the whole book and it left me feeling yucky. The author portrayed the minds of sadistic, narcissistic sociopaths making it a very dark book. And for some reason, I actually didn't find anything that happened a surprise....]]>

I like most murder/legal/crime mysteries because they are about seeking some kind of justice even if the murderer gets off ...I guess books from the point of view/perspective of the murderer are not for me.]]></body>

Now that I have read a few books since finishing that one, I can agree with you that it still doesn't feel right. But also, since I didn't even like the characters, I resent the energy they suck out of me when I try to think of a better ending for them. It is really hopeless given their lack of a conscience. (sociopaths) I, too, wish I had the time back I spent reading this depressing novel that has no redeeming value that I can determine.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I'm so glad to find other people who detest this book as much as I do. There is not one positive thing that I can think to say about it. As others have said it left me feeling 'yucky'. The main characters are so despicable, surely there should be an ounce of sympathy for one of them. This is the first book I have read by this author, I won't waste my time reading any others.]]></body>

As I mentioned in my review, it did seem uncanny the way the author understood the mind of the sociopath. But the mind of the sociopath is not where I want to spend my time in my retirement so I did not "enjoy" or "like" the book. If it wasn't for the book club, I wouldn't have ventured there.<br />Thanks for giving your point of view though..]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This book was recommended by a relative, who only spoke good things about it. After paying the hefty price from<br /> kindle books, I started reading. Right away I was underwhelmed, there was to much verbal filler I felt was unnecessary. I hated the characters, I couldn't connect to anything in this story. I wanted to stop so many times, even after the big reveal, which my cousin said would make it all worth it. Definitely wasn't the case, I not only wasted money, but also valuable time reading this.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[For me this was a book with alot of potential that fell flat, because you couldn't even sympathise with the characters mental flaws. I've read alot of psychological and crime books (I've read from points of views of murderers, pedophiles, fanatics etc) and find them fascinating and I just felt this was a little naive in the subject matter. At times, a little too textbook. The whole plot took a step too far making it unbelievable and at times ridiculous. Nothing shocked me. I just can't see what the hype was about. I'd like to try the author again though just to see if it was just something that wasn't to my tastes as it did have potential.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thank you from me, too, Liz. I agree totally with your review. I kept looking/waiting for something of redeeming value in this book. And I, too, felt I had wasted my time on that book. I should have had the courage to chuck it the trash like others did. But my years of education have left me with such a straight-laced attitude toward books that I always have to finish any book I start even if I don't like it! Maybe the next time I encounter such a creepy book, I'll remember this lesson.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Julie, learning makes us different than the characters in this book! If you are looking for some books with redeeming value, try "The Fault in Our Stars" or the Vietnam classic: "The Things They Carried". I didn't find them a waste of time at all. Happy reading and thanks for commenting.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree. I didn't like the characters, and was bored through most of it. Skimmed a lot. It was, as you said, Yucky. However, since I read it our book club is reading it so I am going to give it another try. I simply can't figure out why this book is STILL on the best seller list, and I can't figure out what it is that I am missing. And it bugs me. It just simply is so hard to read a book when you feel absolutely no connection to anyone in the book.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Paul wrote: "Liz, I couldn't agree more with your review. Can't understand the popularity of this book."</i><br /><br />Paul I have friends who really like it. I think if some just want a fun, light thriller for a weekend/beach read, this fits the bill for many people. Where I am in my life right now, it doesn't work for me. I'm just too emotional about things and I need to read about characters who actually feel for other people. I just read "Animal Dreams" by Barbara Kingsolver and it was the perfect antidote to help me recover from Gone Girl.]]></body>
