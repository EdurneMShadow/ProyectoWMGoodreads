  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winning will make you famous. &lt;br /&gt;Losing means certain death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, is a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by 12 poorer districts. Early in its history, a rebellion led by a 13th district against the Capitol resulted in its destruction and the creation of an annual televised event known as the Hunger Games. In punishment, and as a reminder of the power and grace of the Capitol, each district must yield one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 through a lottery system to participate in the games. The 'tributes' are chosen during the annual Reaping and are forced to fight to the death, leaving only one survivor to claim victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives. , she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[I've been meaning to read Battle Royale for ages but I can never find it anywhere. Blarghs. <br /><br />"I can't stand people waxing about how unoriginal the Mortal Instruments series is then hailing this as an original masterpiece."<br /><br />Amen. I'm a big Mortal Instruments fan––and no, it's not the most original thing on the planet. It has a lot in common with Star Wars and Harry Potter, among other things I'm sure. But it's still good stuff. Someone once told me they hated Mortal Instruments because it was "eerily similar to Twilight." I was like, "... Wha?!"<br /><br />And then everyone talks about how The Hunger Games is so original and ground-breaking. I don't get it. It's like no one has read all the other dystopian books on the planet. I don't understand either how these books supposedly expose all the horrors of warfare, because it wasn't even that violent.<br /><br />Speaking of which, have you read Chaos Walking? Because those books are some dang good dystopia. In my humble opinion.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Brigid: First of all, you go, girl. Florence owns. <br /><br />And I agree. People call up TMI for being copied from <i>Star Wars</i> or <i>Harry Potter</i> or whatever, but then gush over how original and amazing <i> The Hunger Games</i> is when really it's nothing of the sort. It's a derivative thrill. It's a total expo from <i>Battle Royale</i>, <i>A Long Walk</i> and <i>The Running Man</i> (to name a few!)<br /><br />It irks me. Really.<br /><br />I haven't read <i>Chaos Walking</i>, but the title is so kick-ass that I might just have to.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Woohoo! YES. She totally does. I was so happy I found a picture of her reading a book. I was like, ";AKDF;ADSKJFD! GOODREADS PROFILE PIC. NOW."<br /><br />Yeah, exactly. Doesn't make sense. I don't even care about originality that much as long as it's a damn good story with awesome characters. With Hunger Games ... on top of it not being original, I just felt very little connection to it. Whereas, I love the story in Mortal Instruments. And most of the characters.<br /><br />Ahhh, you definitely should. The first book is called The Knife of Never Letting Go. The author is Patrick Ness. I'm a bit obsessed.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This review perfectly summarized the book. It may be good but it is not original. The Long Walk alone is a far superior example of what is truly good about Hunger Games, and Battle Royale is a better example of what is badass. Romantic tumor is he perfect metaphor. Thanks!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[My strategy would be to sleep and stay in those trees lol Or like the girl that was stupid and ate the berries. She would have won if it weren't for her idiocy. I've yet to read Battle Royale however so I don't really know what rules or what they gain from battling eachother on the island so IDK I can't judge between the two. However yes this plot has been done many times before gladiator the dangerous game is one that recalls when i was younger.]]></body>

I should really get to it, but I can't seem to find it anywhere. It's usually always on hold at my library. Anyway, your review is awesome~]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[YES, I agree! Why do people like Katniss at all? Honestly, I found her to be really irritating and haughty. And what is up with the copying Battle Royale? I just finished my review for this book and, like you, I seriously felt the urge to start ranting so I had to cut it off short.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I must say, I agree with you immensely. Your points were just about the same as mine - except I have given leeway to Collins on not knowing about Battle Royale, given it was a foreign book. I've spread the word of that book to others as they never heard of Battle Royale before. It's kind of sad.<br /><br />No way, though. I wouldn't exactly recommend the other two books. Katniss, in my opinion, gets even worse. My favorite character is in the last book - and he doesn't even get a single line of dialogue.<br /><br />I guess this brings up the question on how one in the writing business would look up if their plot has already been done and try not to imitate the same stuff.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Honestly, I loved the book when I first read it because I'd been reading such crap like House of Night and (sorry for mentioning it) City of Bones and Twilight. <br />It is definitely better though, and I have to check out Battle Royal before I get into it being "unoriginal" or whatever. But the thing that really made me realize how pretentious this book is, was when they casted Katniss.<br />Yes, I'm talking about the whitewashing. I'm not gonna talk about Katniss's description or anything, I'm talking about how the book/ franchise shoves down these themes of hunger, deprivation, oppression, and human rights and doesn't even realize the real world connection. Most people (i mean most people- not all) who live under these conditions are those in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, mostly people of color. What the book basically does is borrow these problems to make for a compelling story and applies it to the white protagonist and makes her the "girl next door". And I realize that not all people who aren't colored live in great living conditions- but most don't live in conditions described in the book, so it really makes no sense for them to be represent these real people in the world who do live like this. It especially makes me angry when I watch her interviews telling her audience to think about how many people can't eat in this world when she doesn't seem to think about these things either. <br />tl;dr: This book has no meaning, but it pretends to and its really annoying.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I respect your opinion, but the difference is with Cassandra Clare she was unoriginal in her writing, not her story. and wouldn't you rather read another adaptation of something that's already great or something where someone reuses charcters, descriptions, and copies paragraphs from other writers. It may not be an original idea, but at least she took the idea in her own way. But that could just be me, I like remixed ideas instead of recycled ones. But I'll have to read battle Royale, I heard it was awesome]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I understand your points and all, but I'd just like to point out that no books are completely original. Even Cormac McCarthy, an amazing author, said that his book, Blood Meridian, was pretty much a collaboration of hundreds of other literary works. It's an amazing book and used in school curriculum. Yes, the ideas and themes in this book have been seen elsewhere, but so have those of other, famous novels. Every story, unless plagiarized, is its own, no matter how many other works contribute to its aspects. Don't downplay it because you think it is too similar to another. You don't have to love it, not at all, but you should realize that originality has nothing to do with it and don't use it as a reason. Good review though. I laughed at the "WHO ARE YOU?" part.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Honestly, I can see where you would find the comparisons between BR and THG, but as for the rest you're just wrong.</i><br /><br />Listen, "Katniss." It's Kira's review. It's her <i>opinion</i>. Just because you liked the book and she didn't doesn't mean you're "right" and she's "wrong."<br /><br /><i> I can almost guarantee you, you would've changed your mind had you finished the series.</i> <br /><br />That's not necessarily true. Personally, even though I didn't love the first book, I stuck with the series. And I wasn't too thrilled with the second and third books. I kept reading them hoping they would get better, and––in my humble opinion––they did not. <br /><br />Besides, if the first book in the series doesn't capture the reader enough, they are not obligated to read the rest of the series. A series should capture the reader from the beginning. One has every right to stop reading a series after the first book. Sometimes it's not merely what "happens" in the book, but the writing style and characters that don't appeal to the reader.<br /><br /><i>And her romance with Peeta, is so powerful</i><br /><br />Once again, that's your OPINION and not something Kira has to agree with. <br /><br /><i>And even though their romance is important, it so isn't what the whole book is centered around!</i><br /><br />Umm, in the first book it kind of was. <br /><br /><i>You just seriously had to finish reading it, otherwise all your arguments are just invalid.</i><br /><br />Well, she read the entire first book and part of the second book. Note that the review is for the <i>first book</i> and not for the entire series. So yes, her argument is completely valid. You don't need to have read the entire series in order to review <i>the first book</i>. That's utterly ridiculous. Sometimes I review the first book in a series, when the rest of the series hasn't even been written yet. (And plenty of others do the same thing.) Does that make my argument <i>invalid</i>? I think not.<br /><br />I think an "invalid" argument is when you go on someone's review and lecture them about how "wrong" they are, when really it's just a matter of opinion.]]></body>

People don't understand that we all have different tastes. What you like I might hate, and what I love you might think is stupid. But hey, that's all right! Makes for good discussions.<br /><br />Keep up with your reviews, stay honest to yourself, and stand by what you write. It's all anyone of us can do anyway. If people want to hate on you, ignoring them and not feeding their idiocy is the best policy.<br /><br />:)]]></body>
