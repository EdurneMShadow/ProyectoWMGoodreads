  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

So it's come to this: cheesy video game combat, Katniss' mopey internal monologue, and two boys who are just fine and dandy with being toyed with. They just accept that it's Katniss's right to choose one of them like one may choose a dog at a shelter, then discard the other. They have absolutely no self respect whatsoever.]]></body>

      <![CDATA[[<b>This just in</b>: the movie adaptation, <i>Mockingjay: Part 1</i>, was absolutely outstanding. I've seen both of the other movies for this series, and while I enjoyed them greatly, the third instalment was on another level entirely. It's one of the best movies I've seen in a very, very long time. Good job,...]]>

  <body><![CDATA[Finally someone I agree with about this book! I didn't like it at all. Like you said it was boring and just stupid at parts. But I for one didn't like the ending ha. I hated Peeta such a wimp (and now all the Peeta fangirls are going to hurt me oh well) and I don't know just didn't like his character but then again wasn't a big fan of Gale either. I think the part that really pissed me off in the books was when they were like "Let's make another Hunger Game! Yay!" and Katniss is like "Brilliant idea!" Wait what? The whole point was to stop those games and blah blah blah and you just ruined it... that was when the book took a complete nose dive, crashed, and exploded. Alright I'm done with my rant haha great review!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with Megan. I thought the book was tolerable until they all agreed to have another Hunger Games. Um, doesn't that, you know, go against everything in the previous books?? <br /><br />I also thought the writing got increasingly rushed after they decide to have a final Games. It's as if Collins gave up and decided to take a shit on the remaining pages of the book...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I definitely thought this was the weakest book of the series, and I was disappointed when Collins (after the fact) said the series is supposed to "explore war's effects on children" or something like that. The books had SO MUCH potential to go places beyond "war is bad". Everything just kind of crashed and burned in this one, including Katniss. <br /><br />And don't even get me started on the ridiculous amount of time wasted on that godforsaken love triangle, only to have Katniss just throw up her hands in the air at the end and be all, "hey, whatever, I guess I'm with Peeta". And Peeta was apparently too screwed up to even care that Katniss was basically treating him and Gale both like dirt. Just...ugh.<br /><br /><i>Megan wrote: "I think the part that really pissed me off in the books was when they were like "Let's make another Hunger Game! Yay!" and Katniss is like "Brilliant idea!" Wait what?</i><br /><br />Yeah, I felt like Katniss learned absolutely nothing by the end of the book. And I was confused by the fact that the ending mentions kids, when Katniss specifically said in the beginning that she didn't want kids. Did she get amnesia or something?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Sorry to butt in but I wanted to say this: to me, Katniss agreeing with doing The Hunger Games again is a ploy to get closer to President Coin. I think that's the moment she decides who she's going to kill. That's what I understood when she says something like 'If Haymitch understands me like I think he does'... Anyways, that's my take on it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I tell people to stop at the first one. Once you read the second book, you have to continue. But it's like Suzanne Collins got caught up in all the teen-girl-generated hype on the internet and started thinking she was writing a romance. I was so sad, because Katniss is so anti-romance in the first two books and I loved them for that.]]></body>

I don't really recommend this series - not because it's bad, but just because I don't have any strong loving feelings toward it. But I'd say go for it if you're interested. The first book is good, and the second is outstanding. Just brace yourself for the last one.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with everything you wrote, Kira. This is easily the worst book of the three. I wish Suzanne Collins would call a mulligan on this one and try rewriting it. Because right now, Ashley has the right approach: stop reading after the first book, because once you read the second one, you HAVE TO read the third.<br /><br />There were a few times that I thought, "OK, this is the point where the book is going to be not boring anymore!", but I was let down every time. I was especially disappointed with what happened after <a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[Katniss killed Coin. I expected some sort of fallout—maybe even Snow rising back into power? But no, Snow just got trampled, or... something? And Katniss ended up locked in a room in a paper gown while her trial went on—without her knowledge. Then Gale and her mother leave—without her knowledge. And Peeta comes back and, presto, they get married and make babies, even though she doesn't really love him and she said she never wanted children. <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br /><br />W. T. F.<br /><br />I really can't get over how bad the end to this book was. I just finished reading it last night, and I gave it three stars. Now I realize that's at least one star too many.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Yuuup, you pretty much summed up everything I disliked about this book. Urgh. I also really, really wanted Katniss to end up alone. It just felt like it would have been right. The whole series, I felt like Collins was portraying Katniss as some strong, independent young woman ... but in the end she seemed to kind of give up and then just marry Peeta because he was the only one left. What. If Collins had wanted the series to be as original as it pretends to be, Katniss would have ended up by herself, in my humble opinion.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree, this was the flop of the trilogy. I think Finnick's death should've been different, Katniss shouldn't have completely given up after Prim's death, more character development, it felt like Collins got tired with the series and just wanted to end it. She should have put more pretense to her marriage, how she felt about Peeta (I did like him recognizing how badly she treated him and Gale when he was all trackerjackered up) I just wish he kept some of that fire. I also didn't like how Collins was just like 'oh yeah, Cinna died.']]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I kind of disagree about the marriage bit. While I was incredibly disappointed with the way Peeta and Gale were presented as Katniss's only options, if you think about everything they went through together, Katniss and Peeta would probably end up being really co-dependent and would get married. The children thing was frustrating because I wanted something more original, but it was important symbolically because it suggested that the entire nation could heal and move on. Children always represent the future, and in a series based on the idea of a society that sacrificies the children/future of each district, it's important to show hope for a new beginning.]]></body>

They would represent the change. How Katniss really is okay with having children now that everything is better and she has moved on. Actually I think that's what you were saying xD]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[YES YES YES. THANK YOU FOR THIS. I agree with almost every point. I just found it absolutely ridiculous the number of people who died for absolutely NO reason (aka didn't further their cause), and at times I wasn't even sure who had died and who hadn't, until 20 pages later when Collins decided to throw in a "Ps. That guy's dead." <br /><br />It felt rushed to say the least. And oh. my. dear. lord. Give your readers some credit. We don't need to be bashed one the head with your OMGSOAMAZING symbolism. I got it the first time. Stop explaining it to me.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Awesome review, this is exactly how I felt about the book. I got into a discussion with a friend about it, and she liked it because she related to Katniss' feelings of powerlessness. And talking about it that way made me realize that I get what this book was trying to do and what it was trying to say, but honestly, it did it horribly and there are much better books out there with the same themes.<br /><br /><i>Since when was there an explosive that could fit on the head of an arrow and blow up an entire airship?</i><br /><br />*cough* Seen Avengers yet?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with your review, especially from a YA point of view. If Collins wanted to write this kind of book, she shouldn't have masqueraded it as YA. The entire series should have been more adult driven. But Katniss' behavior is to be expected. She has been thru some truly horrifying, depressing, traumatic shit throughout the series. She should have broken down way before she did. She's just a teenage girl that was brutally thrown in (first, by desperate choice, then as retaliation) into bloodbaths. She isn't a master strategist. She isn't cunning. She isn't a soldier. She was used (by Coin) and abused (by Snow), and there was nothing she could do about it. It is too much to expect her to behave rationally under that scenario.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[If you hated the book so much you should have just stopped. The beauty of books is they are so open for interpretation; I see this book in a totally different manner, the emotional trauma, the metaphors used to depict normal human turmoil and the whole setup of Panem and how it can mimic our own governments (obviously not literally with the Games and stuff). If Collins intentionally killed off lovable characters like Finnick to get the reader upset, it sounds like the goal was achieved. Your clearly upset over the entire book, and potentially the series by the sounds of it. I didn't much care for the ending myself, but after that much emotional trauma, who wouldn't want a happy ending?]]></body>

That statement above is the biggest load of bullshit anyone on GR can ever say to me. I'd rather you just told me I was a crazy heathen bitch than say, "If you didn't like it, why did you read it?"<br /><br />It's just ignorant, anti-intellectual, sour grapes garbage. I just can't stand it. "You should have just stopped". No. No, I should not have. Because if I had, you'd complain about me writing a review when I hadn't read the whole book. <br /><br />I just hate that statement so fucking much. It infuriates me.

  <body><![CDATA[I absolutely loved the first 2 books but this one was so hard for me to finish. It just didn't work out that well for me like the first 2 books. I still like this book though and the last few pages were great but the deaths of some characters were so pointless, I can't even. like i just can't. I almost cried when I read that Finnick died. I'm not even joking and then Prim. Who even does that??!?!? well yeah just wanted to share that with ya]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I'm destroyed now. I read this book in about 3 days and ate it up, I loved it. But reading the review and all the valid points you made, I'm starting to remember all the 'little' things that set me off by this book. I still loved this series and maybe its just my under- developed brain that made Mockingjay an easy read for me. I probably cried through half the book. I saw the desperate breakdown and of a teenager, which is what Katniss was. I guess I didn;t care that she was fickle and moody and sometimes unsure of who she should be and what kind of person she wanted to be with. on that note, I hated the last ten pages. It was the worst part of this series for me. This intense and confusing relationship just gets wrapped up in a pretty little bow with children (who are each a gorgeous, perfect pairing of their parents) and mommy and daddy tell stories of how they brought down a society? I really wanted more from the last look at Katniss and Peeta.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Your opinion is exactly what I feel. Exactly. It actually scares me how much I agree with every single word you said. Especially the part about how many gratuitous deaths there were in the story. The only one I'm really mad about was Finnick's. The author wrote like as if though it wasn't important enough to be epic and important. What the hell.<br /><br />And the Mockinjay Katniss. She was a completely different character than Catching Fire, and it made my mind explode on several occasions.<br /><br />Anyway, you've got the right idea, my friend, and your opinion is spot-on.]]></body>

That's cool. It's perfectly fine to see the faults in something but still have such a warm place for it in your heart that you can't stop loving it. Some books just have so much sentimental value to us and that's honestly the best feeling.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I would agree with SOME of what you're saying. I thought that the book had a lot of loose ends. The Gale and Katniss relationship totally sank, I honestly really didn't like her being with Peeta, he's kind of a dweeb, and he certainly is not as strong as Gale. I believe that Katniss and Peeta are a structurally better couple because Katniss is the fire and Peeta is levelheaded, so I think that they will be okay. I feel like throughout the whole book, or at least the parts when she realizes her powerful role, but she is also powerless. This quotes sums it up. "<br />Quote #2<br />It isn't enough, what I've done in the past, defying the Capitol in the Games, providing a rallying point. I must now become the actual leader, the face, the voice, the embodiment of the revolution. The person who the districts—most of which are now openly at war with the Capitol – can count on to blaze the path to victory."(Katniss) This shows that her persona is powerful, but she physically is not very powerful. She is a puppet of the president, and her prep team. Although she is powerless at first she begins to realize her growing power in this quote,"A new sensation begins to germinate inside me. But it takes until I am standing on a table, waving my final good-byes to the hoarse chanting of my name, to define it. Power. I have a kind of power I never knew I possessed. Snow knew it, as soon as I held out those berries. Plutarch knew when he rescued me from the arena. And Coin knows now. So much so that she must publicly remind her people that I am not in control (Katniss)." This is when she started to realize that her power is palpable, but like most times with Katniss, everyone else knows more about her than she does about herself. She didn't know her own strength. I do not really understand your irateness. It was a decent book to a great end to a series. Granted there were some loopholes in the plot, but it was still a good read]]></body>
