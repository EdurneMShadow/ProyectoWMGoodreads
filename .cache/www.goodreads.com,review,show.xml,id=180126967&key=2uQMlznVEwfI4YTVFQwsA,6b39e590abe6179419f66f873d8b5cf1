  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winning will make you famous. &lt;br /&gt;Losing means certain death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, is a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by 12 poorer districts. Early in its history, a rebellion led by a 13th district against the Capitol resulted in its destruction and the creation of an annual televised event known as the Hunger Games. In punishment, and as a reminder of the power and grace of the Capitol, each district must yield one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 through a lottery system to participate in the games. The 'tributes' are chosen during the annual Reaping and are forced to fight to the death, leaving only one survivor to claim victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives. , she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[It IS meant to be enjoyable, your right. But not in the way you think. It was meant to be enjoable because it was disturbing. It is kind of hard to explain, but take 1984 by George Orwell for example. It is sickening, disturbing, violent at parts, and just downright scary.It makes you sick to your stomach, it makes you angry, it makes you sad, but that is why it's good.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hi Brandi--Although, I could see your point for finding this book revolting; it seemed odd to me that "people finding death entertaining" would be so absurd to you...refer to the history of mankind: public hangings; public burnings; nailing people to crosses; gladiators; street fights; justified executions by the state; boxing; ultimate fighting competitions...etc, etc, etc...fact is, humans ARE entertained by things that should be revolting. Think of it; when's the last time a crime scene did NOT draw a crowd on "on-lookers" or when a horrible car accident does not cause "rubber-neckers".]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I'm not shocked by the fact that people find the book entertaining. That's why crime shows are so popular. <br /><br />It's just that I expected more going into this book, and I was disappointed by the end. I've tried rereading it to change my opinion, but it's still a no-go for me.<br /><br />I'm sorry I don't like this book as much as other people do. I wish I did, because behind all of the heart-pounding violence there is a moral ready to be found. I just didn't like the way Suzanne Collins unveiled it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hi Brandi,<br /><br />Your comment "No, what truly revolted me was that the competition was meant to be entertaining - not just to the vain audiences in the corrupted society, but to us readers, as well. So much of it was written in a way that we would find it appealing... imagine, finding death appealing." spoke to me because I'm not much a fan of violence at all, and I was surprised that I enjoyed The Hunger Games as much as I did. I personally was not happy about ANY characters dying, and the competition itself did not appeal to me, but in a strange way it did (not for the reasons you may think). I took the games in context of screwed up Panem - the games are a gritty reality there, and I saw the world through Katniss' eyes - how it must feel to know she might not make it out alive - that she has to kill other people and her own peer. These children are innocent - I don't think the author's intention was to be all "HEY AWESOME LET'S WATCH ALL THESE KIDS KILL EACH OTHER FOR OUR LOLZ" - I think she was trying to paint a dark picture about a government in control, a city full of people who DO merely see the games as entertainment because the victims are dehumanized, the districts that suffer from starvation, the richer districts that are close to the government where being a tribute is an honor, etc. I did want to know what would happen next to the characters. I do get why you hated the book - I just wanted to chime in because before I read The Hunger Games I thought I'd hate it for reasons you mention, but I ended up loving it for different reasons.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I didn't think I was going to like the book either, but I did. I still don't find it believable that anyone would send their kids to fight to the death without starting a revolution first. Once I decided to forget about that part, I didn't feel like the killings were meant to be entertaining to the readers. I'm pretty sure they were meant to be shocking and revolting and make you feel sick over what a government could do to its own children. It stirs up a lot of anger about the injustice of it all, just like it did for Katniss, and makes you hope for some kind of revolution in the next 2 books.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[There is a huge difference between 1984 and this book- in 1984, you learn something about humanity. The main characters have character and depth, and their relationships seem real. The Hunger Games have none of that. I agree with your review entirely.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I really enjoyed your review, and I agree with much that you said. I still saw the book as very powerful; unlike 1984, Brave New World, Handmaid's Tale etc, I saw the story as relating less to governmental control than to our society's fascination with the macabre, our tendency to let a screen and a story dehumanize other people for our own vicarious entertainment. I think the irony that in telling the story, Collins makes us complicit in the fate she warns against, as entirely intentional. But I agree, I think this message has been lost as the book gained popularity.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Most definitely. Great analysis :)<br /><br />Even though I gave it one star, I don't think it was a complete failure of a book. It just wasn't for me, or something.<br /><br />I actually think it's a little better than 1984. (Shh, don't tell anyone I said that.) ;)<br /><br />Maybe if I'd read it before all the hype, I would have felt differently. But having a lot of fans can really change a book's effect on you.<br /><br />I wonder if the first fans of Harry Potter felt the same way?]]></body>

Even worse, I wonder how the <i>author</i> feels. Although now that I think about it, if the author really had the motivations I imputed to her, would she have sold out and let her story be made into a glamourized and disneyized movie? I haven't seen it, but from what I've heard, it creates essentially the same picture of the story that the Gamemakers create from Katniss's experiences. Oh, well. It just goes to keep the cynicism and irony alive, I suppose...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I read the trilogy in under a weeks total time. Once I had seen the movie trailer and Jennifer Lawrence in it. Who by the way I found to be pitch perfect as Katniss. Opinions are subjective. I can see how you can come from where you are in your opinion. I personally loved the books. As I told a friend though the actual games are but a portion of the overall story. I think you need to read all three books to get a full appreciation of it all. If all three were just about the actual games and in the arena I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much either.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Yeah when I first seen the flick in theaters I had big problems with it. Second time around I was able to enjoy it more. I think they did a decent adaptation but like all movies I found it to be not as good as the book. Some key character moments were left out of the film and some that were in it were sped through too quickly.<br /><br />In the book I found the games a necessary evil to get across how dire straits the citizens lives were and how under the thumb they were of the diabolical and controlling rule of the Capital. And it did serve to set up the larger story better. Personally though I was more likely than some to enjoy the books.<br /><br />I'm drawn to strong female characters. BtVS remains my favorite tv show ever for that reason. And while a lot goes on in The Hunger Games and succeeding books. Love, rebellion, despair, etc. At it's core it is about Katniss. It's a story about a girl who gives up her life to save her sister. It's her story that drew me in and its her that drives everything that happens after. I think that's why the series is so popular. Because of the Katniss character.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[You are brave for laying out your "unpopular" opinion! I think that maybe I liked the book because it had a deep meaning and a riveting story/plot, which I find tremendously lacking in most books published these days. I've read several classic dystopias, and a reason I could support this book is because I found it provocative to the current generation the way Brave New World was for its generation. The truth never changes. For a nonfiction version of this story, which was also in the back of my mind as I read Hunger Games, I highly recommend "Amusing Ourselves to Death" by Neil Postman (written in the 1980s about TV but far more relevant today with the Internet). However, I recall being highly disturbed about, say, 12-year-olds reading this novel. I'm in my thirties, and I could never recommend or approve of a young teen experiencing the gore of this novel. I'm surprised that it was promoted as a young adult novel (age range being 12-18 years). If the youngster has a caring parent who reads it alongside them and discusses it with them, that is not such a problem, but I just don't think a lot of kids who read this or see the films have such normal communication with their parent(s). I'm surprised when Lord of the Flies is required reading for 8th graders. Isn't the full meaning lost on such youngsters? I also would not recommend Harry Potter to young teens for being very dark, and darker as the series progresses. However, I found Harry Potter to be too dull to finish reading (although I finally suffered through the last film without stopping it and returning it to the library beforehand). How's that for "unpopular" opinion? I enjoyed your thoughtful review, and I hope someday to be a "goodreads" author and have you critique my books! :)]]></body>

You made your point with class, more than I see in some of the responses. Don't beat yourself up, &amp; consider it a good thing that you wrote something worthy of feedback. I will look for your other reviews, and maybe we'll agree!]]></body>

If people are upset about seeing one-star reviews, it's their problem, not yours. <br /><br />Please don't change your rating only because some butthurt fans can't stand people expressing negative opinions about a book they like. Trust me, a lot more fans of THG actually are mature enough to handle one star reviews.]]></body>
