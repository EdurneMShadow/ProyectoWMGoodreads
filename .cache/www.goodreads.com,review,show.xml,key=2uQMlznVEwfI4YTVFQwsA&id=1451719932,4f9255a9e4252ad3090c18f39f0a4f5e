  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[I read that the reason she picked Peeta was because of the shit they've been through together. Gale apparently didn't understand what they had all been through. Peeta helped her cope with all the crap and PTSD (which she apparently has?).<br /><br />I dunno. <br />The third book was very disappointing. Not because of who she picked in the end, but how it was executed. Everything was rushed. Especially in the movie. <br /><br />Like the thing with Prim.<br />It was like: boom. ok done. next scene. <br />Bored. I was. BORED.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[ROFL! I've been dying to see what you thought of the finale! I honestly didn't mind the conclusion when I read the books a few years ago. I've definitely read worse. That ending, as in the very very end, may seem worse *because* you saw the movie first. I cannot believe how drugged JLaw/Katniss looked holding that baby at the end. <br /><br />When I read the book I honestly believed Katniss ended up where she belonged and her life with Peeta was the right one. After the movie though... I walked out wishing Katniss had died in a blaze of glory instead of getting a medicated ending with Peeta's offspring. It was awful.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I see you've reached the same conclusion and pretty much reacted similarly as my boyfriend did rofl.<br /><br />But yeah, I have to agree with you with a lot of this. First two books I blazed through them, then got to this, yes I cried and was a bit of a mess by the end of it--especially with a certain part. But I must admit the ending left me wondering where did Katniss' strength go, but with watching the final part I've realized that she's tired by this point. Tired of being directed, being forced into a role that she did not particularly ask for, and even being a part of everyone's games. But I do agree the whole Peeta, while I'll admit I'll enjoyed his character and adored it in the first two books, it was during this that made me wonder why when it was clear of that his condition was unstable. Either way, it just reduced Katniss in a poor way, along with everyone else playing different characters. <br /><br />I think everyone was just tired like a bad nightmare gone wrong in so many ways lol.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I really don't like the ending. Too short and no Hayffie. But this trilogy changed my life and is my favourite one so ... XD Glad you liked Gale though cause he is not very popular while I like his point of view. I love all the characters seriously.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[And this, right here, is why I'll never own the series, despite what I enjoyed about it.<br /><br />A lot of times in many different series, when the stakes are high, I'm wondering, "Who's going to survive? Who's going to die?" but with Mockingjay all I felt by the last third was, "Will ANYBODY be left?" I was depressed after the final page, in more ways than one.<br /><br />Thanks for this review, dear!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I actually enjoyed the change within the characters in this book, because I felt it expressed a weaker side of Katniss and showed how in reality she was actually incapable of handling the pressure placed on her. However, I do agree that it could have been handled more effectively and though I wouldn't ask her to change the characters or the plot Collins could have had a better buildup and just done the book better overall.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hey, I'm still team Peeta but I do agree he SUCKED in this one. He was weak, he made Katniss weak and Katniss made the book weak. Gale? Although I never really liked him, I don't hate him. I just pity him. Even though Gale comes off as a jerk, he is really kinda just fueled by his anger in the third one. Plus, after games happened he never stood a chance with Katniss because he doesnt get her like Peeta does. So of course he was going to have only one goal in this book and that goal completely destroyed both him and all the other beloved characters *sigh* <br /><br />Even though I'm glad Katniss ended up with Peeta (I do think she did made the right choice) but the way it happened and how their romance was handled in this book was so cringe-worthy.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[AMEN! For me, the Katniss we grew to love died in book 2. This book was just complete BS. Katniss was but a shell of herself, for god sakes she spent half of the book drugged up. I always loved Gale (especially here) but it was obvious Collins loved Peeta more, she was practically shoving him down my throat with his "goodness". And Finnick, poor freaking Finnick!!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Sigh. As I was watching you binge read the previous books, I was absolutely certain you weren't going to like this one, and so I eagerly awaited the angry review (Schadenfreude?)! I actually gave up on this one because she became such a sniveling mess which came off even worse because she was so amazing in the previous books! Sorry Khanh, better luck with your next read!]]></body>
