  <description>Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning masterwork of honor and injustice in the deep South ― and the heroism of one man in the face of blind and violent hatred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best-loved stories of all time, &lt;i&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/i&gt; has been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than thirty million copies worldwide, served as the basis of an enormously popular motion picture, and was voted one of the best novels of the twentieth century by librarians across the country. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father ― a crusading local lawyer ― risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Lit Bug,<br /><br />My that's all I can say. You've read this book (nearly) seventeen times! I had a friend who watched the movie "Casablanca" 57 times and I thought he was nuts. However, I love the "Thomas Crown Affair" DVD with Pearce Brosnan and I could watch that for ever. I love the music. It mesmerizes me. It sets a spring in my stride.<br /><br />I particularly liked : "Striving to follow this dictum, I have realized how difficult it is to be kind to others when I find I’m right." I'm a bit like that myself. <br /><br />So, I already have this book and I must read it.<br /><br />You are remarkable. You're getting close to Dolors but I still think that Dolors is in the lead...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Whatay spell-binder of a review Lit. It's always tremendously moving to find another person's passionate eulogistic writing on something they truly cherish. I remember reading this in my first year of college, too late in life in fact. But it was one of those rewarding reading experiences I never forgot. Your review reminds me to revisit this some day in the future. It is inspiring to find at least one human being who has internalized the guiding life principles this book upholds. Brava!]]></body>

Blame it on India or our society in general or my defense mechanism. I loved the movie version of this book.<br /><br />To be honest, I have little hope of any book changing my attitude in a big way, but this review of yours just makes me want to try it.<br /><br />Being kind is a difficult/tedious job,isn't it.

  <body><![CDATA[There are a few great adjectives here preceding the word 'review' already, but I must say, stunning review. <br /><br />You illustrate perfectly what Harper Lee was trying to promulgate with this classic book. Especially when you mention the certain characters who appear unpleasant and villainous at first glance (as well as the clever mention of one of Wilde's many vibrant and brilliant quotes). Indeed, everyone is the protagonist of their own story and everyone has goals, dreams, hopes and motivations. I don't know what more could have been said, I'm jealous I didn't write it myself!]]></body>

Crude as it is (my review), this was my 'koshish', my effort to express my gratitude to something that kept me from becoming indifferent and self-righteous.]]></body>

I remember we also watched the film after we read th book. Gary Cooper - you couldn't have found a bettr actor to play Atticus. I haven't read it since but it remains with me. It' one of those books.

The remarkable thing to me is that so many kids who were forced to read it <i>didn't</i> dislike it!<br /><br />I somehow managed to not read the book until my 30s, when my wife practically forced it on me. No regrets :) Atticus Finch, even if he is purely fictional, is America's answer to Gandhi.<br /><br />Lovely review!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Wow! 17 times in a span of 5 years? That's gotta be a record. I understand it though, I love this book myself. If there was any guy in literature you can set as a role model, you can't do better than Atticus Finch. He's like me, if I was perfect. heh heh. Actually, I just finished reading a novel about John Brown and the african-american plight back then, so racism and motiveless malignancy is still pretty fresh to me. Though reading the perspective of an african-american kinda helped me understand things a bit. It says something like: 'Everyone's got opinion bout slavery, you can ask the yanks, the southerners, the christians, but nobody asks the negro. Everybody's got a say on slavery but the slave himself.' I think this still kinda applies to some countries, like India, who are behind in gender emancipation, in human-rights, and are subject to unfair customs and practices. That those people it subjugates can't help themselves even if they want to. And maybe, like John Brown did, it takes a revolution to change things through. Hahaha. I'm not a radical, but I really am for human-rights. Caste-systems and Male Chauvinism are the worst. I hope to hell things change in India, and in other places where they still have that. Amazing and Empowering review, LB. Keep on rocking. Tell one of 'em chauvinist pigs to "fuck off!" for me. Cheers! See you around.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[@Traveller - Thanks very much for the kind comments!<br /><br />@Jr - yeah, India's a terribly complicated people with its uncountable divisions and therefore unlikely but true alliances. Maybe its a good place to visit,, but a horrible place to stay. I don't see any significant social change coming for at least 50 years. Yeah, am pretty pessimistic, but since I've read quite a lot on India right from Ancient and Medieval history, more things have stayed the same than having changed. It's a messy, gloomy place with occasional glimmers of goodness and hope. I don't even know how it has managed to survive its implosions. <br /><br />And gender is just a minor issue - there are a lot more worse issues raging here. It is a continent in its own right, rather than a country.]]></body>

A lot many Indians bash other people for speaking up against the grim side of everyday India, but most of the criticism is true. It's a sick place, a country whose wounds are infected so deeply that it will never really heal. Someday, I'd really like to talk about it all, in massive detail. You'd be aghast then. It's like living in a stinky, festering flesh that you know will only worsen with time.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[The British have to be blamed to some degree for India's current problems—as they do in much of the world. They imposed a single state over a lot of smaller ones, but I can't help wondering whether India might be in a better situation today if they hadn't done only half a job.<br /><br />Would India today be a more stable society if the British had imposed a single culture on the sub-contintent, the way China has over its own sphere of control? India is actually populated about 3 times as densely as China, despite China's larger total population, so I wonder if any nation so large &amp; densely populated can ever be stable.<br /><br />[and let me assure you, even if such an Indian society was more stable, I'm not advocating it. I'm Canadian, and we still believe multi-culturalism can work, when European countries all call it a "failed experiment"]]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I've seen societies where multiculturalism does work. All you need is some basic goodwill. Even societies that have fragments of French in the mix. <br />It's tempting to blame French partisanship for the separatism in Canada, but I suspect there might be deeper issues than only that? The French haven't always been that separatist everywhere, although I guess they have a good track record of tending to keep themselves in a clique.<br /><br />Talking of China, China's cultural, erm, the acculturation of especially North and South China through the centuries, wasn't exactly an easy affair...<br /><br />I suppose one could look toward the Roman Empire as a model of multiculturalism working quite well?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Derek (Guilty of thoughtcrime) wrote: "The British have to be blamed to some degree for India's current problems—as they do in much of the world. They imposed a single state over a lot of smaller ones, but I can't help wondering whether..."</i><br /><br />You're quite right when you say the British can be blamed to "some" degree - the Brits could do it only because Indian society itself was a fractured, highly unequal, oppressive and exploitative, not to forget extremely selfish in nature. The Brits only took advantage of the internal rifts, and although everything the Brits did wasn't right, not everything they did was any worse than what we already were doing to each other under the approval of a different culture.<br /><br />Honestly, given a chance to turn back history, I'd say I prefer the 400 year Brit rule to leaving India in charge of its own land. I am thoroughly convinced that India would have been only slightly better off than Middle East today had it not been for the Brits.<br /><br />And this isn't my blind adoration/fixation with the mythical liberal West speaking, I've been thinking over this since at least 5 years, going over past and present events, wondering how it would have been if Brits hadn't come over. Already, we would have been slaughtered by the Portuguese, but suppose no one had discovered an alternate route to India after the fall of Constantinople, we would still have been mired in that exploitative culture.<br /><br />Don't fall for the metanarratives, the Grand Narratives about Indians being so family-oriented, so generous, so kind and warm people - they might be that to foreigners (Indians have a massive crush on the Whites and <i>Firangis</i>), but you need to integrate here for a few years to see beyond that façade.<br /><br />Multiculturalism can work, but like anything else, it needs goodwill. Currently, in India, even if people manage to develop goodwill among each other, political factions will step in deliberately to make a mess, incite hatred on some or other counts, and divide public opinion to gather votes from their targeted cultural/socio-economic/minority-majority group. Things here are too twisted, and nobody cares for the nuanced truth - they believe what they're told, until the representation replaces truth itself.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[A very powerful and thought provoking review,Lit Bug.Some of the possibilities you cite in absence of the British colonization of India may have come true;for one, we may never have emerged as a nation, and the decadent monarchy and zamindari system may have gone on.But maybe,a visionary ruler would have united some states of the land and led us to be an evolving kingdom? What causes me the greatest anguish is the traits of mental slavery,subjugation and holding some "other force" responsible for everything that happens to us instead of owning individual responsibility. This, I feel has become a genetic mutation after years of slavery and grovelling. As of now, may be we need to be compassionate with others, but less so with our ownselves.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Karen - I read your comment and enjoyed it. I would like to add that To Kill a Mockingbird is required reading for High School Students still to this day. The movie is still being shown after the students are finished the book. I'm sure this will remain as a continued requirement in the High School curriculum in the future too. Thanks for that comment. <br />I would just like to make one correction about your movie comment. It was Gregory Peck that played the role of Atticus and not Gary Cooper. The reason I know this is because I am a HS teacher and have seen this movie many many times, I can't even count how many times I've showed it to students. I enjoyed it every time. It's a good movie and Gregory Peck gives a great performance as Atticus.]]></body>

The two books seem so much two halves of a whole than what I ever expected.]]></body>
