  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Haleema, I couldn't have said it better myself! Mockingjay lacked the action and thrill of the first two books and I get that Collins was trying to be all ironic with the deaths, but seriously, they just annoyed me. Plus, I hated how she ended the love triangle! I've been Team Peeta from the start, but even I thought that Gale just walking out without an argument or fight and leaving Katniss's life was a <i> tad </i> bit unrealistic (not that I'm <i> really </i> complaining or anything though). Katniss just got super irritating in this one as well...gosh I pre-ordered this and remember sitting up all day to read it, waiting for it to get better, and all it did was get worse! :/<br />Brilliant review though!(:]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Katniss wasn't the leader of the rebellion. She was the symbol of the rebellion and her role was propoganda, not fighting. No wonder you didn't like it. You were looking for something entirely different than what the book is actually about.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Now that I think about it, I agree. However, I still believed that this last installment of the series lacked the action and thrill the first two books had, despite the overall devastating feel to the book.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree that this installment wasn't as good as the first two, especially because of the poor pacing.<br /><br />However, I really enjoyed it and identified with Katniss, though likely for reasons Collins didn't intend. I was in the Army, then an Army wife while my then husband was deployed to Iraq during the more hopeless years. Myself, my then husband, and our friends mostly weren't old enough to drink but we were thrown into situations we could hardly comprehend. (Yes, we volunteered, but I don't know that a 19 or 20 year old can really give informed consent to go to war.) By the end, we were hurt on a deep, spiritual level and just over it.<br /><br />Katniss is whiny but she was manipulated into a role she doesn't want for people she (rightly) doesn't trust. What is the point of all this war if one dictatorship is replaced by another? What was the purpose of all of those deaths? I imagine her feeling like we did--great, I just aided in this death and destruction at great personal cost and nothing changed. The anticlimactic death of Snow seemed incredibly appropriate to me--power passed from one dictator to another, no matter, let's just continue the destruction and oppression without fanfare.<br /><br />Did Collins intend to write an allegory about the impact of Iraq or Vietnam on the psyche of young soldiers or was this a rushed book? It's most certainly the latter but she accidentally did an ok job of the former along the way.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[YES. This book seriously just killed me. Last books series like this usually seem rushed and terribly painful. BUT THE PAIN IS UNBEARABLE. So many deaths like by the time Prim's rolled along I had no tears, I was just numb with depression. And could they at least give Finnick a death TAKING UP MORE THAN TWO SENTENCES. Like, I had to retread it because I nearly missed it! Wait what? Did he? ....crap. Then more overbearing feels... :(]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hmmm... She's not the leader of the rebellion, she is the symbol. Two very different things. Hence, making her the most important person, and the one that is forever trapped in whose ever agenda she fits best. I thought it was a very good interpretation of how people in power use that power, and how it exposes everyone to their whims of either justice, freedom, and honor. This book however wasn't about the revolution, but what happens to the symbol of one.]]></body>
