  <description>&lt;b&gt;About three things I was absolutely positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Edward was a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there was a part of him—and I didn't know how dominant that part might be—that thirsted for my blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first book of the Twilight Saga, internationally bestselling author Stephenie Meyer introduces Bella Swan and Edward Cullen, a pair of star-crossed lovers whose forbidden relationship ripens against the backdrop of small-town suspicion and a mysterious coven of vampires. This is a love story with bite.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Thanks for the recap of Twilight resources for people who just don't get this series (I refuse to call it a saga because it isn't one). I love Reasoning with Vampires. I stumbled upon it a while ago but had forgotten about it. The grammar lessons are invaluable. :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[You are welcome! All this wealth of Twilight snark just begged to be shared.<br /><br />Speaking of SAGA: Here is a true saga-like recap of Eclipse from the great Cleolinda (all hail her name!):<br /><br /><i>"EDWARD CULLEN was a mighty sparklepire, and of the greatest fangirls; and now he heard that Victoria, That One Vampire Who Demanded Vengeance For Her Slain Lover, Even Though He Was A Severe Asshole, And I Don't Really Know What Else She Expected To Happen When He Kidnapped The Tasty Beloved, Yea, To Torture And To Eat Her, had got her gone from South America, where Edward the Bronze-Hair spent the Second Song of the Saga looking for her even though that totally wasn't where she was because he kind of sucks at that whole thing, out to the Far Ghetto of Seattle, where she made to raise an army of her own. Supersparklespeedy were his doings thereon; he gave his forests and his mountain-lions into his not-kinsmen's hands, and betook himself to the highest mountain, or at least a pretty high mountain, unto the camp-tent of his beloved, where she made out with the Unthroned Wolf-Chief, but we're not going to dwell on that right now because I don't want to throw the Saga against the wall again; but despite his valiant efforts the Vengeful One followed after, nor was she unaware of his goings."</i><br /><br />Continued <a href="http://cleolinda.livejournal.com/886601.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.]]></body>

A fellow Cleolinda fan :D<br />I love all of her m15m parodies - "Cousin, just cousin" bit from 'Troy' was quite awesome.<br />Have you read her 'Movies in 15 Minutes' book?<br /><br />I still harbor hope that someday she will pick up where she left off in her Secret Life of Dolls...]]></body>

Different strokes for different folks, right?<br />In the meantime, I will be quietly hoping that no spin-offs or remakes (or, in all honesty, badly written fanfics sweeping the nation) are in the works. On the other hand, there may be many out there who would love to see the abs of teenagers apparently allergic to shirts - the sight I could (and will) do without. And finally, as the silver lining, maybe there will be more hilarious recaps and parodies as the result of this self=perpetuating Twilight culture.]]></body>

And there are enough huge books left over that I still want to read, that I don't think I have to resort to Romantasy (is that a real word in English? - I got to spend some time in Frankfurt a couple of weeks ago on a layover, and saw in a bookstore that Twilight and the like were shelved as "Romantasy", and thought that was pretty clever).]]></body>

I had actually looked at the shelf because "roman" just means "novel", and with the English connotations, I was wondering if "romantasy" was actually English.]]></body>

(Sorry, but I can't help myself).<br /><br />Honestly, I don't object to anybody reading Twilight. It's not (I think - I'm honest, I haven't read it and don't plan to) my cup of tea. But I attended a lecture by the Canadian journalist &amp; editor <a href="http://www.robertfulford.com/" rel="nofollow">Robert Fulford</a> a few years back (ok, more than a decade) where he talked about reading and encouraged people to read _anything_ - including Harlequin Romances (and this is from someone who's considered to be part of the Literati), and I completely agree with him: reading is better (much better) than not reading. I've known people with two post-secondary degrees who don't read anything. I'd rather spend an evening with someone who reads Harlequins, or comics, or Twilight, than people who don't read fiction at all.<br /><br />In fact, I'd rather spend an evening with Robert Fulford, and I had his brother as a high-school English teacher (and we did _not_ get along - but then I stole his bedroom furniture, so I guess we're even...)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[You are completely right, Derek - reading anything is almost always better than no reading at all (I can think of a few examples to the contrary, but that's not relevant to this discussion). I only sincerely hope that books like Twilight will serve as stepping stones to reading for people who otherwise would not have picked up a book - that is, stepping stones to anything of better quality. In that case, I can make my peace with these books - while reserving the right to make fun of them mercilessly (and support others who do, too!)<br /><br />The bedroom furniture stealing story made me curious...

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Nataliya wrote: "You are completely right, Derek - reading anything is almost always better than no reading at all... I only sincerely hope that books like Twilight will serve as stepping stones to reading"</i><br /><br />I haven't talked to the local librarians about Twilight, but when I read the Harry Potter books, I did, and they were all thrilled. Kids who'd never read were picking up the books, and parents who'd never read _to them_ were reading them too. From then on, JK Rowling could do no wrong in my mind! I think Meyer is probably nearly that important.<br /><br />OK, the bedroom furniture... You know that was just a teaser :-)<br /><br />There's three high-school teachers involved. The English teacher and the guidance counselor were getting a divorce, and as soon as it was finalized she was going to marry the Music teacher. He (the Music teacher) was probably the most important person in my teenage life, so when he wanted people to help him move, I was right there... Then he told us that his girlfriend had got the bedroom suite in the divorce settlement, but that the ex- wasn't letting her have it, but we knew that the ex- was off visiting _his_ girlfriend. Three or four of us (fortunately, we're way past any statutes of limitiations...) proceeded to break into the house and liberate the entire contents of his bedroom. I still have absolutely no idea if she really had a legal right to the furniture, but I'm sure they wouldn't have lied to me :-)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Rowling did get millions of non-readers to read, and I suppose Meyer tapped into the rest of the non-reading demographic. But, having read the works by both authors, I still cannot equate them. I happen to agree with Stephen King, who famously said: <i>"Both Rowling and Meyer, they’re speaking directly to young people. … The real difference is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer and Stephenie Meyer can’t write worth a darn. She’s not very good."</i><br /><br />That bedroom furniture story strikes me as quite funny. You can actually say that you've tasted the life outside the law because of your admiration for your music teacher! Now how many people can ever say that?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I know many teenagers who had no interest in reading whatsoever until they heard about Twilight. They read Twilight, which is a pretty long series for non-readers. Now they've discovered the joy of reading and continue to do so with better books, and some of the same quality. I have to applaud any book that introduce youth to reading. I think we need books to bridge that gap. Not everyone can start out with Moby Dick or War and Peace. <br /><br />I read them myself. I enjoyed them to a certain extent and I enjoy the movies. Mostly the wolf aspect. I still think Bella's one of the weakest women in literature. However, I'd read the whole series 3 times over before I so much as read the back cover of the "classic" Tess of the Dubervilles again.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Casey, I'm not advocating starting with the classics, especially for teenagers. I've hated my share of classics when I was the age of the intended Twilight audience.<br /><br />I just hope that at least this series will be a stepping stone to a better kind of popular literature (and not to 50 Shades of Grey type of books - shudder) - after all, there are quite a few quality popular books around, just waiting to be read. But I guess we have experienced the unexpected popularity boom for both Harry Potter and Twilight in the last decade and a half - and I don't think any of these sudden explosions of fame could have been predicted. I guess people want to read what they want to read, even if it leaves so many of us completely baffled.]]></body>

I refuse to believe that.<br /><br />Speaking of Wuthering Heights - every time I came across a frequent reference of it in that book (as well as Romeo and Juliet, by the way) I just wanted to take the author aside and politely tell her that constantly mentioning classics in your work does not make your work any more classic or respected.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Rakhi wrote: " Some of my students(20 something girls at college) are Edward Cullen fans, and in love with the series. I am at loss with words whenever they try to talk me into. "</i><br /><br />You know, I find it hard to fathom how anyone can be a fan of Edward Cullen. Sure, I understand that most of women will have some longing for a bit of romance and devotion, and even for a bit of protectiveness. But Edward Cullen takes these traits to the extreme, which results in the very controlling, manipulative and unbelievably codependent relationship - which, t make it worse, <a href="http://io9.com/5413428/official-twilights-bella--edward-are-in-an-abusive-relationship" rel="nofollow">apparently fits all the signs of an abusive relationship</a>, which is because it is indeed <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/psychologist-the-movies/201111/relationship-violence-in-twilight" rel="nofollow">an abusive relationship</a>. Edward is domineering, has a condescending paternalistic attitude towards Bella, withholds information from her supposedly for her own good, dictates who she can and cannot be friends with, disables her car when she tries to see a friend Edward disapproves of, lies to her, continuously reminds her of her weaknesses and flaws, blames her for the situations she has no control over, disregards her wishes, uses his family to basically kidnap her and hold her against her will... Need I go on? And to top it all off, both of them seem to be obsessed with preferring suicide over separation - a healthy emotion, isn't it? When people say they love Edward Cullen, I'm always tempted to ask whether the fact that your boyfriend chivalrously opens car doors for you really outweighs being in an unhealthy relationship.]]></body>

I see on her wiki that she got a B.A. from BYU but nothing about her teaching. Hopefully just a false alarm.<br /><br />SO true though! If an author uses it cleverly as a metaphor or allusion, or to expand on it, then I see it as okay but not to just try and sound smart ha. I hear that in music all the time too. Referencing a Johnny Cash song does not put them on the same level!]]></body>

My next door neighbour is one (Graphic Arts), and I think she's probably pretty good in her field, but the closest she's ever been to a writer is when <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3534.Toni_Morrison" title="Toni Morrison" rel="nofollow">Toni Morrison</a> had an office down the hall when she was a writer-in-residence at Rutgers (I think - New Jersey, anyway).<br /><br />Still, I would guess that if her wiki says she has a Bachelors degree, she might have been a tutor or teaching assistant, but definitely not a prof. Even to get an Adjunct Professorship (basically, access to the university library), she'd pretty much need at least an Honorary D.Lit.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA["Hurt" seems to me to be one of the few cases where the cover is stronger than the original (another one that quickly leaps to mind is Nirvana's cover of 'The Man Who Sold the World'). I think it's the decades of weariness and real-life experience of pain Johnny Cash was able to convey that made that song from just interesting into heartwrenching. Hearing Johnny Cash sing that song, especially that line 'everyone I know goes away in the end' and 'beneath the stains of time the feelings disappear', delivered from the weight of the years on his back - those lines just do something to me every time, they make me choke up. Reznor's original lacks the emotional punch. There's such a different quality in the 'what have I become?' question in the two versions - regret and pain in Cash's cover versus the detachment in Reznor's original.]]></body>
