  <description>&lt;i&gt;Night&lt;/i&gt; is Elie Wiesel's masterpiece, a candid, horrific, and deeply poignant autobiographical account of his survival as a teenager in the Nazi death camps. This new translation by Marion Wiesel, Elie's wife and frequent translator, presents this seminal memoir in the language and spirit truest to the author's original intent. And in a substantive new preface, Elie reflects on the enduring importance of Night and his lifelong, passionate dedication to ensuring that the world never forgets man's capacity for inhumanity to man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Night&lt;/i&gt; offers much more than a litany of the daily terrors, everyday perversions, and rampant sadism at Auschwitz and Buchenwald; it also eloquently addresses many of the philosophical as well as personal questions implicit in any serious consideration of what the Holocaust was, what it meant, and what its legacy is and will be.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Thank you, Cory, for this review. It’s not an easy read at all, it can even be physically painful. You handled the review with grace, tact, and lucidity on a subject that is utterly horrifying. That was amazing!<br /><br /><br />Now, go and read some Pusheen or Simon’s Cat to help restore you!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<b>Heart wrenching review. </b> My 16 year old and I just started this book bc it's required for his literature class. We are taking it slow bc it's painful to read but has so much depth. You can't read this book and not be changed. <br /><br />I'm glad I saw your review. I'll be sure to show him. Out of curiosity which one is the author in that picture?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This is an incredible review of one of my favourite pieces of literature. I, like you, found that reading this book profoundly changed me. I went on to become a teacher, and then to work briefly at a Holocaust education centre where I was privileged to work with our survivor speakers on a daily basis. I don't think I can describe to you the impact of looking into the eyes of someone who faced Mengele and was sent to the right as his family was sent to the left. I will be forever grateful for the chance to work with those men and women - each one left a mark on my heart and soul.<br /><br />As for the "how" of it all... I was watching a YouTube video recently of a black student at UCLA who was protesting discrimination in the school's admissions process. The video was spoken word poetry. All of it was excellent, but one particular line struck me and I was immediately reminded of the Holocaust: <br /><br />"Because no snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible."]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thank you so much, Catherine. Oh dear God. You worked with survivor speakers. I can't even really process that. I think that if I ever met a holocaust survivor, ever heard them speak their story, some large part of me would break beyond repair. One of my grandfathers was in a later wave that arrived at Buchenwald but we only know that through his military paperwork. He never spoke about it. <br /><br />That line of spoken word really does say so much. O_O]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[There’s actually people who think this was all made up as a wartime propaganda campaign. My college history professor was one of these people. The first day we hit this in our texts, he loudly denounced it from his podium, saying it was bogus and as made up as the moon landing. The school had arranged for two survivors to come speak, one of whom was a Schindler Jew. I was assigned as liaison and had tea with them that morning. I told them his disbelief and asked if they still wished to continue. They said yes, and followed me to the class. When they entered and were introduced, the man went over to the professor. Without being asked, he rolled up his sleeve and showed the tattoos. Very softly, he said, “Tell my people this never happened.”<br /><br />Most epic class in all my life.]]></body>

It doesn't stop it from happening, but it means that people like your professor can at least be prosecuted for it. It astounds me that it isn't similarly illegal in the United States considering how many camps were liberated by US soldiers.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[It’s like you said, modern humans have no concept. We don’t want the believe that we are capable of this sort of thing. The flip side is that we also have an infinite capacity for good also. That’s what I’ve seen with both G.I’s and camp survivors I’ve met. They saw these things happen and they responded in the opposite manner: caring, compassion, love, humility, perseverance, etc. I was floored and I’ve never cried harder in my life.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This is the best book review I ever read. It's glorious, Cory, because it's so true. And I totally agree. How is the question, isn't it? Not why. Why, I can understand. Evil is the answer, but how did the average person/german let this happen? How? That I will never understand.<br /><br />And you pose an excellent question: What are we really capable of? I always question myself when reading dystopian books, I always try to analyze and reflect on what I would be capable of to survive and to save the ones I love? And when I'm honest with myself I have to confess that I think would do plenty of horrible things. Although, in my heart I hope that isn't true. But I'm a fairly bloodthirsty person, so that worries me. I really hope I never have to find out. But, I should add that I would be more capable of despicable acts to saved loved ones than to save myself. I don't really value my own life that high and I don't have a strong survivor instinct. But I'd go absolutely insane and even evil to save my grandmother and my mother (if she was still alive). I'd be capable of signing my soul to the Devil if it saved my grandma. I love her that much.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thank you for this beautiful review. I was unable to gather my thoughts together for a review that would do this book justice, but it fundamentally changed the way I thought about the Holocaust and the greatness, both evil and good, that ordinary, everyday human beings are capable of. It made those long ago and far away events very real and personal to me.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I like to read things like this just to remind myself what beasts we humans really are. <br /><br />Just as Maya Angelou said <i>"I’d like everybody to think of a statement by Terence. The statement is, “I am a human being. Nothing human can be alien to me.” If you can internalize the least portion of that, you will never be able to say of an act, a criminal act, “Oh, I couldn’t do that.”<b> No matter how heinous the crime, if a human being did it, you have to say, “I have in me all the components that are in her or in him. </b>I intend to use my energies constructively as opposed to destructively.” </i> It's a double-edged sword, I can be as good or as bad as anyone else. It's a conscious choice and every single day it takes work. <br /><br />Your story is touching. I can't imagine what shock it must have been to suddenly be exposed to material like that, since we grow up hearing of those things since kindergarten. It's uplifting that even people from USA learn about those parts of history. It should never be forgotten.]]></body>

I was seriously disturbed reading it at (lol, well I'm just not going to say!) but I'm a grown-up and found it disturbing to say the least...good!, but disturbing. I wonder if my total entitlement generation children would benefit from a big dose of reality by reading this as a young teenager. I do believe it's good to see the world for what it can be even especially for the bad, a little less oblivion then...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[@ Babs: Thank you so very much! And I'm in the same boat as you. I think I'd do some terrible things to survive, even more to keep my loved ones alive. <br /><br />@ Anna: That quote is slightly terrifying. And now I think I'm going to go snuggle with one of my cats near the Christmas tree. <br /><br />@ Amy: Yup, 13. It's required eighth grade reading in the school district I grew up in. I really feel that every generation of children should read this. And I honestly think that the early teens is the best time for a first read. I think it's one of the most selfish times in a person's life and this book is a great way to shock people out of it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This is probably one of the best reviews I've ever read. Remarkable and poignant - this book still haunts me today. The last book I picked up regarding the holocaust was Boy in the Striped Pyjamas - which was good, but in my opinion, Weisel's will always be the best.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to write this]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[this is probably the most well-thought-out comment I've ever read. I'm in 8th grade now and my English teacher told us about some situations in this book such as the bread fight between the boy and his dad. I feel the same way: how can this happen to people of my descent??? I am jewish and I just cannot possibly imagine myself going through what Elie Wiesel had to endure.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thank you so much, Mia. And yes, this book pretty much highlights the very worst that humanity is capable of. As to the bread fight between the boy and his father, they'd been completely dehumanized by that point, reduced to their most base state. Anything seems to be possible when we're so broken.]]></body>
