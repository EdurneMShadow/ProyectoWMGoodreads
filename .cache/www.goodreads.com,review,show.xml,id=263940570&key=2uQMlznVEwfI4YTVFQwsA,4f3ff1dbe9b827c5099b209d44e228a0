  <description>&lt;i&gt;There is an alternate cover edition &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25856606-the-fault-in-our-stars" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, then all at once."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the tumor-shrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis. But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel's story is about to be completely rewritten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insightful, bold, irreverent, and raw, The Fault in Our Stars is award-winning author John Green's most ambitious and heartbreaking work yet, brilliantly exploring the funny, thrilling, and tragic business of being alive and in love.</description>

      <![CDATA[At age twenty-two, John Green worked as a student chaplain in a children's hospital. <br /><br />Let's take a moment and consider all the implications of that, and why he is making a colossal understatement when he described the experience as "devastating." That was about twelve years ago, and Green has said...]]>

  <body><![CDATA[Yeah, I've found that John Green just can't seem the shuck the chains of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl. This time it's just a guy instead of a girl. I did like how sometimes Hazel called him out on it, at least in her mind. Like when they were at the art park, and later she was like "that seemed so fake" and I was like "THANK YOU." But, you know, I forgave him because he stomped on my heart at the end. <br />Also one thing that was a minor annoyance: the "ghettoization of eggs as breakfast food?" What a hipster nonimportant thing to worry about. But maybe that was the point? But it didn't feel like the point, it felt like Hazel (and Green) though it was genuinely important? Idk! <br />But otherwise, brilliant novel. DFTBA!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Fabulous. this book reminds me of Sarah, the 16-year-old who died in hospice. I know I told you about her service, and how her favorite books were stacked on the tables at lunch following her funeral. I'm tearing up just remembering. Not to mention Paul, who you knew...sigh.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Awesome review! I hate that John Green never seems to escape from that Manic Pixie Dream Girl thing, especially because he seems to be conscious of it and really attempted to address it in Paper Towns. From what I'm hearing, Hazel seems to be overshadowed in her own book.<br /><br />Though I should stop reading reviews and just see for myself, I guess!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I don't think there are any Manic Pixie Dream Girls in this book, or anything close. Some people have argued that Augustus is just a male version of the MPDG, but I disagree. For one thing, we get to know him as a real person rather than an object of worship. Also, he doesn't ruin anyone's life.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I don't know you, so I hope you will excuse my intrusion on your review. I've been a fan of Green's for years, but this book stopped me dead in my tracks. <br /><br />Kudos to you for recognizing what it is truly about, as I am a childhood leukemia survivor, and it about knocked me over cold with its Truths (with a capital T, because that is what they are). <br /><br />I've waited a long time for someone to capture the life of a teenaged cancer patient without all the ridiculous melodrama and profound moments tuned to whiny string orchestras. Green captured it in all its essence, and for that I am humbled....]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Good review, but i think you're too hard on the cigarette thing, he's not doing it because he actually thinks it takes away the power, it's just like holden's red hunting hat, he does it when he feels insecure and wants to isolate himself]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I think I like that explanation better. And maybe Augustus just does it because he's trying to create some semblance of control in his life - when you're dying, even imaginary power over a killing object is better than nothing. <br /><br />But I maintain that it's still a dick move to explain this metaphor to a cancer patient. Holden Caulfield's red hunting hat wasn't manufactured by a company that profits off a product that regularly kills people, and he didn't wear it around dying people, some of whom were dying as a direct result of red hunting hats.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with your view on the cigarette thing. I didn’t find it very necessary at all to Augustus’ character. Maybe it made him feel powerful? Maybe that was the point. It seemed that he was showing some sort of “I had cancer, and I have something that has the power to give me cancer, but without a flame it won’t.” attitude, and it confused me as to why he would pay money for such a futile feeling.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Now that I've read interviews where John Green explains the cigarette metaphor in more detail, I understand why he has Augustus say that. It's not John Green telling us, "Look how cool Augustus is," it's John Green telling us, "Look how passionate but dorkily misguided Augustus can be in his beliefs." Like another commenter pointed out: Hazel doesn't fall in love with the Augustus who makes up convoluted explanations about why he buys cigarettes, she fell in love with the Gus who gets really excited on his first airplane ride.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with how real you say John Green was. He was far from treading lightly on the suffering that Hazel and Gus went through. I also agree with Gus's cigarette smoking. The idea that he is giving money to the people who cause cancer also came to my mind and boggled it. I like the metaphor of taking away something's power, but not in the context of a cigarette in the hands of a cancer patient.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[but thats the thing. its a metaphor. you're not suppose to walk around a mall with a shot gun even though its unloaded and perhaps he's not suppose to buy an entire box of cigarettes to live by a metaphor but it makes him feel something. like in a world where he didn't ask for something, he feels like he can control what little power tha cigarette has and it sort of makes him feel benevolent, hence the jackass attitude.<br />besides, john green wanted to tell something and i guess he thought that using a cigarette as a metaphor would be an ironic way of humour because the protagonist afterall has tumour in her lungs.<br /><br />and if you really think about it, yes you are giving money to the company that causes cancer but only if you light the cigarette up.<br />if you don't then you can't give them the power to give you cancer.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I was just about to comment and point that out: cigarette companies make money from people buying their product, and they don't really care what anyone does afterwards. Obviously they prefer that you smoke the cigarettes and fuel your addiction, therefore buying more, but the point is that with every pack he buys, Augustus directly funds an organization that gives people cancer. <br /><br />And it's true that if you don't light the cigarette you "can't give them the power to give you cancer" but that's not the point. You bought the cigarettes, therefore you gave money to the cigarette companies, and they will spend that money making more cigarettes that will then <i>give people cancer</i>.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Madeline : <br /><br />This is such an awesome review! When you say you review every read; YOU REVIEW EVERY READ! I have been wanting to read this book for a fresh easy read for some time now . Sometimes my book club , which I REALLY LOVE don't get me wrong , includes some very challenging reads. I like mysteries dealing with a great bit of psychological and analytical thinking about the complex characters , unfamiliar settings, and ways of life that bring up very challenging conflicts. Our group reads Historical Southern Gothic or as my cousin Larry Brown called it Southern Grit Lit. <br /><br />I guess it is like the indie rock of reading or maybe some bluegrass indie in there too!! HA! The Writers and the musicians inspire each other as well as the country home cooked foods and their beverage of choice from Sweet Tea and Lemonade to straight up Wild Turkey on the Rocks or Yalabusha brewed Beer. <br /><br />Now some of the pre- 1980 reads take place during prohibition times and the post - 1980 reads can take place in the Ozarks where all money is made in Meth. labs . After I have had to much darkness, I need some easy reads too calm my soul!!! LOL ! <br /><br />Now I want this one and I have Donna's new book. If the new book connects a little to Secret History , I might need to speed read a little to remind myself of some specifics from that old favorite. I wish she would write more than one book every Blue Moon ! You definitely have the same taste I have in reading. I really don't do FooFoo reads unless there is just nothing around to read. My Aunt Jane got the idea one year I liked Nicholas Sparks just because I did like The Notebook. Now she always try's to give me his books. Sad! I do break down and read them eventually . HA! <br /><br />Loved the reviews ... I am going to try to get a new MAC this week. Cross your fingers. My brand new Windows 8 died last April when an old classmate from high school became fixated on me when he found me on FaceBook. I was cautioned about his changed behavior so he sent lovely gifts ( viruses, key loggers, stealth genie spies and even got into my icloud) that ended my tech days until just recently! I got an iPad Air in November. Love it! But it is not a whole computer. I will never use windows again until they put money into a security system. Apple is finally save after their latest upgrade to IOS7. <br />Be careful out there Miss Madeline . There are bad men everywhere! Good night moon! Your Little Friend, Dawn]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Madeline - I was hoping you received my message on The Fault In Our Stars ( TFIOS). When I finished the book, I was so excited to share my excitement and joy with you! Without you having read Donna Tartt and connected to my review, I may have missed out on one of the loveliest stories I have read all year. I tried anxiously to write to you and ask and answer to clarify things for me and I think I came up with ideas on some other interests that I found out from things I studied and taught in school. I hope I did not sound like a know it all little nerd anxiously waving her hand to be called to answer questions in class! LOL! But I felt like that after I read the book and wanted to share. <br /><br />Mostly- thank you very much for enlightening me about an awesome author with more good books to read and for reminding me how wonderful my English teaching experience was when I taught Secondary English Education for 15 years. I cried because I wish I could have been a teacher to have taught that book. I wish I could have seen the students reactions , even the students that say they don't care or are too cool to read. This book could have been one of those that brought communication about important stuff and I could have slipped in learning things about, themes, conflicts, symbolism and more in a way they may never have forgotten. But, most of all , can you imagine being in the middle of augments when they try to discuss belief systems about life and death, or love and true love, or the importance of a life rather known to all or known only to make a difference by few. Then there is that metaphor for being independent or reckless or having the right to take fault for your own mistakes. That cigarette had nothing to do with a company -- at different points in that novel , that cigarette was a metaphor for independence, pride, self assurance as being a person over which there could be no control unless he decided ( which we find out in the end is a farce) . Everyone must eventually learn in life that you do not control your own Fate or Destiny , God is the only spirit with strength to control . You can't control people either, only God , and you just have to accept you can do the best you can do make things better for you and people you love. The rest is up to you controlling how you REACT to fate, circumstances and the actions of others. Augustus Waters was putting that CIGARETTE in his mouth as a flag saying, " Hey, I am a grenade " too. Don't get too close I am going to explode and I will hurt you. The same point to adults and parents, I am what I am - accept it-- babies don't smoke. Mom and Dad, if I chose to blow, it will not be your fault or anyone elses. Finally, take a look at Massif's pyramid again. What do you see there scientifically and symbolically? Then when they give into love on the Second Floor of the Hotel in Amsterdam, look up the name of that second floor, Kriekenkard ( spelling? ) was a philosopher who believed in mysticism or Existentialism. This is the belief that one can only know God through his / her own intense emotional experience. How do people prove God must exist? You can't see him, touch, or hear him. How do you know love exists ? You can't see it, touch it, hear it, ---YOU ONLY FEEL THE DEEPLY FELT CONNECTION AND EMOTIONAL CATHARSIS IN YOUR ON MIND AND BODY. Augustus once says to Hazel Grace, how will I ever see you again? He is referring to LIFE AFTER DEATH . There is so much REAL DEPTH IN THIS NOVEL ! I can't even begin to finish here. And, there is no telling what I missed.<br /><br />Madeline - there is so much more ... Now, one thing I thought about ...tell me to FO if you want. If you felt that strongly about the cigarette metaphor being bothersome, then what other symbol could Green have used. I have been trying to thing of something . What do you think? <br /><br />When you get time ... Thank you again, Dawn]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>If you felt that strongly about the cigarette metaphor being bothersome, then what other symbol could Green have used.</i><br /><br />I have no problem with Augustus employing the cigarette metaphor as a way of coping with his illness. What I have a problem with is Hazel making the point that Gus is <i>directly funding</i> an organization that causes cancer when he buys these supposed "fuck you, cancer" cigarettes, and this perfectly valid point never being addressed in the book. It's a serious flaw in Gus's character, but a necessary one - that he can believe in something so strongly, even if that belief is wrong. I would just have liked Hazel to press him more on the overarching effects of his dumb metaphor.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I think that was the point too! Hazel kept saying how perfect Augustus was over and over compared to so many others including herself. She was so overwhelmingly flattered by him at first to even bother addressing the issue at the first meeting because she had been so charmed especially after the depressed state of isolation from which she was coming. She did sense his imperfections by the next visit. She questioned the metaphoric cigarette again and realized that was another of his imperfections besides his driving. No one can be totally perfect although we seem to think so at times. <br /><br />In this case , John Green is basing this story loosely on a girl named Esther Earl as I am sure you know. She actually had cancer of the thyroid which then led to her lung condition. Although cigarettes did not probably cause her cancer, she still would be angry because they would cause other cancers and they would have direct impact on breathing . <br /><br />Somehow John Green had to get the " DO NOT SMOKE MESSAGE IN LOUD AND CLEAR" which is maybe why he even left the point about the cigarette companies open. He may have wanted it to bug people . <br /><br />Otherwise, the act of free choice is opened. Free enterprise is opened. Freedom in genera is a big thought. Along with carrying the theme The Fault In Our Stars; we all have flaws. Even superheroes have weaknesses. <br /><br />Do you want to see the movie?

  <body><![CDATA[Okay, but here's the thing: Hazel Grace is not Esther Earl. John Green has said over and over that Hazel is nothing like Esther. The foundations for this book were laid fifteen years ago, when Green was working at a children's hospital and observing kids going through life-threatening illnesses. It's likely that Green's friendship with Esther was what finally gave him the method of approaching this story (which, again, he has been trying to write since he was in his early twenties), but <i>The Fault in Our Stars</i> is not about Esther Earl. It may seem callous of me to say this, but <i>The Fault in Our Stars</i> was always about John Green. Every John Green book is about John Green, first and foremost.]]></body>

For the Movie Trailer Release on Sat. February 1, 2014 they streamed an Esther Earl Day Celebration. John did talk on the Vlog about Esther that day. <br /><br />That is all. She did have some influence on John as a person with cancer. Just as all of the rest. Ester Earl 's story had a similar romance I believe. Maybe I will read her book today. <br /><br />It is a nice rainy cold day here. I need to do laundry anyway. I am not arguing Madeline. This is just what I saw Saturday. I am sorry. <br /><br />Dawn]]></body>
