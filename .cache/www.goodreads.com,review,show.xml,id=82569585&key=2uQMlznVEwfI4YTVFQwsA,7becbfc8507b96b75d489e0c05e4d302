  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

For a year, I had been anxiously waiting to read the about the adventures of the rebels, the hopefully happy ending. How wrong was I. There is an ending - but it is not as happy as most expected it to be. The rebels fought, the...]]>

They have to get him back!<br /><br />Hahah, anyways, I'm really looking forward to this book. I think the open ended though would be nice, though I have to admit when author's do that I can't stop thinking about the possibilities and it really gets in under my skin, because I want to know what happens.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm really looking forward to the book.<br />Just...6 more months.

  <body><![CDATA[At first I was really rooting for Gale too, but Peeta sort of grew on me. Damn that Peeta. Because while what happened with Katniss and Gale is totally unfair, and I feel ruins their trust and any sort of relationship they could have had, what happened to Peeta was unfair too, and I just have to root for him. Suzanne makes it easy to see how Peeta is a better person than Katniss. While I doubt that Suzanne would kill her off, I can see why she wouldn't be on your 'Have To Live' list. <br /><br />Your fourth prediction is my favorite as well, except I think someone important will still end up dying, along with the rest of what you have said. My guess is, Haymitch is a goner, with the direction I think she is going. I'll be sad to see him go :(<br /><br />I don't really mind if Gale dies, as it will leave Katniss feeling less guilty for having feelings for Peeta, but I'm concerned for his family, and the fact that his death might negatively affect Katniss and Peetas relationship instead of helping it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[It seem like someone important will die in the 3rd book. I hope that in this book Peeta will not be rescue by katniss. Instead, he'll find a way to escape with Johanna (in a way i don't want her to die) then meet up with Katniss and help her with the rebellion. That way Peeta won't be the damsel in distress anymore. I really hated how he's always get injuried and portrait as the weak character even though he's capable of so much more. I also want to see more of Gale character because even though he appread more in CF i still feel like i don't really know him that well.<br />OMG i wish it's august already &gt;____&lt;]]></body>

She really was acting dumb in book two I thought. <br />I would hate it if Gale ends up with Katniss, but I would hope for Gale to find someone else.<br />I do honestly think Katniss will end up with gale though, sadly. I am a peeta fan so I would like Peeta and Katniss to end up together, But I think Suzzane is going to kill him off....]]></body>

I hope that Katniss and Peeta would end up together, Gale with Madge (hopefully), but right now it feel like she'll end up with Gale :( <br />Poor Peeta]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I was rooting for Gale at first, but I think Peeta deserves it more, after all he's gone through. But I don't want any of them to die. Although I'm sure some of them will.<br /><br />...<br /><br />I have to wait until OCTOBER 5TH for <i>Fearscape</i> (this other book) I <i> hate </i> waiting. It drives me crazy.<br />(Not to mention waiting for <i>Bitterblue,</i>April 1 2011, <i>Sammy Keyes 13,</i> 2010 and <i>Mastiff,</i> 2011) <br /><br />Maybe I should plot world domination with Opal while I'm waiting. Hmm...<br /><br />~edit again~<br /><br />I just finished Catching Fire and I think Gale deserves it more now. Peeta's awesome, but I think I know who Katniss will choose...<br />"Gale is mine. I am his. I can't believe it took him nearing the edge of his life for me to realize that..."<br />...I <i>think</i> that's what she said. Anyway, due to the Quarter Quell, I'm still not sure. She is really confusing =S<br /><br />~edit once again~<br /><br />Yes. Poor, poor, Peeta. *cries*]]></body>

I don't like the idea of Gale and Madge together. I love them both, but Gale belongs with Katniss. <br /><br />There are other books in YA literature that have a first person narrative and the main character dies, so it might be possible... it would definitely make the series memorable, even more so than it is. But since that angle's been played, I'm hoping she comes up with something completely unseen before.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I absolutely love this book series. However, it is the first book where I have moderately to strongly (I can't decide) disliked the main character. In case someone is terribly behind, that main character is Katniss. She is brave, strong, determined, intelligent, and kind at times. It's just that for some reason I can't bring myself to relate with her as much as I can with other main characters I've seen. Anyways, back on the subject of Gale and Peeta. Short and simple, I can't decide. :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Well Katniss can't exactly die, can she? Since the books are in first person? With her as the narrator?<br />And I kind of dislike Peeta. He kind of uses the fact that he likes Katniss but she doesn't like him as a way to make her feel bad. And sometimes he's sweet and perfect and stuff, and other times he's a jerk. But I guess thats how people can be... But I actually go back and forth between Gale and Peeta :) so yeah.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Am I the only one who finds the Katniss/Gale thing kind of weird? I preferred their platonic friendship as it was written in the first book. I wish that more young adult literature (hell, who am I kidding, more literature in general) would allow male and female characters to be "just friends" rather than constantly pairing them up and making all their interactions romantic or sexual. It really doesn't give them enough credit as fully-realized characters.<br /><br />Anyway, I definitely prefer Peeta to Gale for Katniss... I think his personality complements hers perfectly. Katniss and Gale would just be too much of the same thing. Though I like that Katniss doesn't really seem to <i>need</i> a romance with anyone. She has feelings for both Peeta and Gale, but a relationship is not her main priority.<br /><br />Speaking of Katniss, I'm surprised to see so much dislike for her. I think she's a fantastic heroine! She has force and personality and more than a few flaws - all of which make her far more interesting than all the pretty, boring little Bella Swanns of the world. Katniss is powerful in a way that most female characters are not allowed to be, and she isn't trotted out as being beautiful or sexy to make her more "acceptable," either. She's tough, prickly, and not afraid to get a little ugly. And I think that's awesome.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Yes, I did like Katniss and Gale better as friends. My only hope is that this doesn't end up like Inkdeath did. (I really, really didn't like Doria. Like really. He irked me. Farid was so much better.) Thats probably what it will be like if Gale is chosen as well.<br /><br />Also, I don't know if I would like an open ending either. Most books that ended openly I disliked the ending. It seemed like the author was being lazy and decided to leave out the very last part. But thats just what I think.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I think Katniss will end up with whoever is alive at the end of the book. I can see:<br /><br />-Peeta sacrificing himself, telling Katniss to move on as he dies dramatically and I start sobbing (and Katniss turns to Gale).<br /><br />or<br /><br />-Gale spending all his time at the battle front, and he dies like Katniss' father did, without a trace and I start sobbing (and Katniss turns to Peeta)<br /><br />Either way, I hope not TOO much time is spent on the romance angle. I prefer the rebellion over any of the other plot lines.]]></body>

I'd be happy with either, but she better not kill them! although to be honest I would rather Gale die than end up with Madge! but this is what has been bothering me for ages, in Catching Fire, what was the deal with the blood on President Snow's breathe!?!!? surely not a vampire cause I would be pissed off!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I loved your review I think you really did capture what Suzanne Collins was trying to elude to about the war. I would love to hear her own review of her book and see if it correlates. I think her writing style blew the twilight saga and love triangle out of the water. Where twilight is a teenage love story, this story even though it features teenagers has such a ring of truth and sincerity that even though I am frustrated about the amount of deaths and the near insanity of Peeta and Katniss I find that I cant be mad as Suzanne Collins has made the characters too real that I am slightly depressed. I normally prefer the twilight endings where no one of significance dies and everyone finds there person they love but this trilogy has captivated me more than any book I have read its on par with ' To kill a mockingbird' and 'Under the hawthorn tree']]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[THIS IS THE TRUTH! it is such a depressing book! i think that if it had a happy ending it still would have worked as long as she made it work (Suzanne Collins can work miracles!) this was a not-up-to-par ending to an amazing trilogy. it was kinda cofising ais some bits, and i was soooooooooooo dissapointed that she didnt end up with Gale cuz he was her soul-mat. it was so sad! :( I wanted to cry when everyone died but couldnt and this review has brought tears to my eyes!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Your review was great and I agree with you completely, she made the war realistic in the sense that people die back and front, even people who you thought were too important to die. I have to say, I cried when Finnick died too. I hated and loved the ending, it was powerful in the sense that its no fairy tale ending and she's still scarred from what happened all those years. I found it disturbingly realistic. But overall, love the trilogy and her style of writing.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[i agree with your opinion that the book has an overall tone of deep saddness because Katniss inner toture that she had to witness thoughout the book. however the ending to me wasn't one of sadness but an uplifting one. she defiled all odds and was able to marry Peeta. she made it thourgh the games made to kill her and survived although she was battered and burised she was alive not only that she was able to pick her life back up and didn't use a supplement to cover her pain as so many other vitorys had]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I completely agree with you on the torture being worst than the deaths in some way, and about it not having a cinderella ending since it would remove from the deeper message in the book. Peeta's hijacking was absolutely horrible and tragic and disturbing, and well everything Katniss suffered through was beyond what I could have imagined. Definitely heavy on the bitter, but as you say, beautiful writing !]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[And it didn't nessissarily have a happy ending. I'm glad her and Peeta are together and I like how they show it's not a happily ever after. It's realistic-after all that trauma of course they're not going to be the same as they once were. They're both mentally disoriented, Peeta still has to control himself, but at least everything else is good.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[That's exactly what I thought about it! I was honestly surprised of how complex this book was, because of the success this trilogy had, I thought it would follow the path of other YA trilogies, with is to give a satisfacting ending that will please everyone, and a book full of action. But no, suzanne totally exceeded my expectations. She made it clear that there is not a good side and a bad side in war, she showed how power can change people, and how situations can lead people to do things they thought they never would. She took everything to the darkness and made katniss become depressed and hopeless which was just meant to happen! Mrs. Everdeen may be strong and powerful but through the whole seriers she was traumatized and stressed and she couldn't have control on her own life, everybody had a string attached to her, and pressured her to the limits, of course she got crazy, she had the world in her back, and she, more than anyone, could truly see how horrible was that war. I can understand why people didn't like it, because is not easy to deal with characters that aren't perfect and realistic endings, and anyone that is not able to see things in a more complex way could end up seeing this book as a "too sad and depressing", but anyone that looks for more and is done with the cheesee novels will understand, this is the most perfect ending this series could have.]]></body>
