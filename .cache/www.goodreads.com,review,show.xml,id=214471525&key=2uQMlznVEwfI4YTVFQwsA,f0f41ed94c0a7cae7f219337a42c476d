  <description>The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it, To Kill A Mockingbird became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.</description>

I was just discussing how I wonder the reception this gets in southern states, especially as there is so much discussion on 'southern tradition', so that is cool to hear they really connect. Funny too, I have also worked with this book for a 9th grade English class as well, it seems the ideal time to teach the book.]]></body>

Yea, there are a few books I fear revisiting would pale my impression of them (though others I know I'll only enjoy all the more), and I was pleased to see that this one holds up nicely. It doesn't seem as groundbreaking as when I was 14, but I definitely see why it is a classic and still taught in pretty much every American classroom.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Spenks, I read and loved your review yesterday. However, I was called away before commenting. So I begin today with morning coffee and a return to your review.<br><br>Beautiful job, first of all. Secondly--good on you for your presentation on this novel for The Big Read Program.<br><br>A tip of the hat for your connection to Faulkner's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72228.Intruder_in_the_Dust_" title="Intruder in the Dust  by William Faulkner" rel="nofollow">Intruder in the Dust</a>. As you know, I have a particular fondness for Lawyer Gavin Stevens. ;-) Gavin and Atticus in the court room are quite similar in their approach. Stevens certainly has his share of memorable lines. However, he never had the benefit of being portrayed on the big screen by the likes of Gregory Peck.<br><br>My favorite Stevens quote does come from "IitD."<br><br><blockquote>“Some things you must always be unable to bear. Some things you must never stop refusing to bear. Injustice and outrage and dishonor and shame. No matter how young you are or how old you have got. Not for kudos and not for cash: your picture in the paper nor money in the back either. Just refuse to bear them.”</blockquote><br><br>It certainly bears some similarity to Atticus' stirring "In the name of God, do your duty."<br><br>As Ms. Lee has often done, she has contradicted herself on the source of Atticus Finch. Soon after the novel's publication she firmly stated that Atticus was based on her father, Amasa Coleman Lee, who was a small town lawyer, who was a member of the Alabama House of representatives, and who was appointed to represent two black men, a father and son, accused of murdering a store clerk. Mr. Lee, as Atticus did, served up his best defense. However, the all white jury returned verdicts of guilty. Amasa Lee represented the last two men hung in the Monroe County Jail. He was present at their execution. That case was the source of his disdain for the practice of criminal law. Who could blame him.<br><br>It was as editor of the Monroeville, Al., newspaper that Amasa Lee covered a rape case almost identical to the facts of the "Tom Robinson" case. Lee was not appointed. However he covered the case extensively. The verdict in that case was guilty. The sentence was death. Interestingly enough, a letter writing campaign, believed to have been initiated by Amasa Lee, resulted in the Defendant's sentence being commuted to life. As Miss Maudie said in the novel, "Baby steps."<br><br>As to Ms. Lee's contradiction, she subsequently said her father was <i>not</i> the source for Atticus Finch. Personally, there are too many similarities between the lives of the real Amasa Lee and the fictional Atticus Finch, for me to accept that. Rather, I chalk it up to Ms. Lee's pursuit of privacy for which she has become renowned.<br><br><a href="http://s1151.photobucket.com/user/mmcsullivan/media/MrLeeampMrPeck_zpsd69cc752.jpg.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">

  <i>Art imitates life,</i>
</b><br><br>We have very little about which we disagree. One issue is Calpurnia. I have never perceived her as an Uncle Tom character. She never bows or scrapes. She is certainly not a "Step-n-fetch-it" stereotype." She is a human being with whom Atticus confidently entrusts his children. Perhaps it is because I am a Southerner who was similarly entrusted to the care of black women when I was a child, which was not an uncommon arrangement. These women were family to me. I was taught to obey them as I would my mother or grandparents. My responses were to be "Yes, Ma'am," or "No, Ma'am." This is not meant to be a denial that racism existed in the South. It certainly did. But not in my home, nor in the homes of friends. <br><br>The novel still astonishes me to this day. It is one of those rare works to which I can return time and again with the assurance I will never be disappointed. I chalk that up to Ms. Lee's epigraph from Lamb. There is no suppose to it, really. Lawyers were children once. TKAM has inspired so many children to become not only lawyers but those who have the integrity of Atticus Finch. From time to time I return to this novel to remind myself that integrity does exist though in reality, as it does in any profession, is not always found in every individual that practices. In essence it is a return to the safe haven of childhood when all lawyers <i>were</i> Atticus Finch.<br><br>Well...it's been a long time since you and I have talked. I appreciate your having written this review very much. Should you wish to borrow a line from an old retired Southern Lawyer, feel free to do so. However, you certainly have no need to--beautifully rendered review. Would love to be at your presentation. <br><br><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7078095.Scout__Atticus__and_Boo_A_Celebration_of_Fifty_Years_of__To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_" title='Scout, Atticus, and Boo A Celebration of Fifty Years of "To Kill a Mockingbird" rel="nofollow" by Mary McDonagh Murphy'>Scout, Atticus, and Boo: A Celebration of Fifty Years of "To Kill a Mockingbird"</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4120488.Mary_McDonagh_Murphy" title="Mary McDonagh Murphy" rel="nofollow">Mary McDonagh Murphy</a><br><br><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/337788.In_Search_of_Atticus_Finch" title="In Search of Atticus Finch by Mike Papantonio" rel="nofollow">In Search of Atticus Finch</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/109499.Mike_Papantonio" title="Mike Papantonio" rel="nofollow">Mike Papantonio</a><br><br><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114408.Mockingbird_A_Portrait_of_Harper_Lee" title="Mockingbird A Portrait of Harper Lee by Charles J.

  <body><![CDATA[This is quite simply one of the best reviews ever written! I wish I could attend your presentation, even if it turns out to be a repeat of your written words here. Every one of your points is solid and insightful. I especially liked your observation about the mockingbird being akin to innocence.<br /><br />We have a cat, too, but it may be closer to the opposite end of the moral spectrum. His name is Attackus Afinch. ;-)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Mike wrote: "Spenks, I read and loved your review yesterday. However, I was called away before commenting.

Seco..."</i><br /><br />Thank you so much for all your kind words and wonderfully insightful response, Mike. It has certainly made my day! I was unaware of the Lee/Atticus connection but I think you are definitely right, especially as so much of the novel came from people she knew. It was especially entertaining reading this again now with the knowledge of Dill being based on Capote! That picture is great too, such a resemblance. Peck remains one of my favorite actors, that court scene is just incredible.<br />I actually had you in mind when I wrote about the Stevens connection! And I will agree that my Calpurnia interpretation is a bit off-base. I suppose I wanted a bit more of her insight, and thy probably stems from just wanting everything to be more Faulkner-ed up ha. But not all books can have a final chapter from the household attendant like S&amp;F I suppose ha. <br /><br />The bit about lawyers and childhood is incredible too, and in definitely going to work that into my discussion. That really ties the childhood safe haven into the book all the more so, and I've always liked the idea of Atticus as the defender of innocence and good in a world beset by troubles. In a way he is almost a Catcher in the rye in some vague sense. <br /><br />Thank you again, I can't wait to read through all the links after work today as I prep for tomorrow. It has been far too long and it is good to hear from you.. And I will certainly drop you a line, nothing more important than good friends and good books!]]></body>

I absolutely love that movie and should probably watch it again tonight ha. So true though, and I think that movie, as well as C.Eastwood westerns, were why instilled in me such a respect for characters of conviction. It's a trait I like above almost all others, nothing better than someone who is About It when they decide to do something. That goes into McCarthy novels as well, conviction seems to be what separates those who live from those who die (particularly No Country)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Wonderful, insightful review, as always. It's reminded me that my mother and I started reading this together when I was in school, but never finished (probably because I became a jerk teenager who was home less). Never read it in school, because I went through a lot of "alternative" schooling and missed a lot of American Classics. Will have to find this when I go back to my mom's house over the holidays and restart it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[As always, an excellent, excellent review. I've been wanting to re-read it ever since I read Malcolm Gladwell's controversial (and admittedly flimsy) take on it (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/08/10/the-courthouse-ring" rel="nofollow">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/200...</a>).<br /><br />I struggle with my memory of this book--is it the classic I thought it was or well-meaning white liberal moralism that doesn't actually say anything interesting about race? Can it be both?]]></body>

And nice, ill read that now. I appreciate Gladwell and he makes good points, but I also struggle with my opinion of him as its mostly pop-psychology and he definitely assumes correlation as causation. <br />I was glad rereading it solidified it as a classic in my mind, and I feel she used race more as an example of a larger theme than being the pressing issue. And the race issue has been donr before by people like Faulkner in a similar context. I think the racial elements get highlighted most often as it is a good teachable moral and works well in the classroom, as well as being a more approachable book than, say, Faulkner, for modern classroom purposes, but its really just a part to a whole.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Mr. P, I feel honor in being able to read your excellent opinions on any occasion, but feel unusually blessed today as I am a rare bird, that of a man both educated and literate (at least in the eyes of some) who had not until this weekend, at the age of 38, read the book. I had not seen the movie -- nor wonder of wonders -- had any details spoilt by a jaded world. I imagine the idea that an adult had not read it was too foreign a concept to be worthy of consideration. I just wanted to thank you for the review, and to add one small tidbit about any sense of heavy-handedness. As a first time reader of the book, despite being familiar with literature before and since, they lost none of the emotional impact I suspect they had upon you and many others on their initial reads. Should those lines you cited will wear a little heavy on my eyes the next time I read the book I shouldn't be shocked, but they hit the first time reader just right, I think. Thanks again!]]></body>

I'll admit my 'heavyhanded' comments are a bit harsh, I've been trying to write more balanced reviews other than just gushing about a book ha.

But it has one of the most influential and adored. I consistently thrust a copy of this to any friend who say they haven't read it. And ofcourse they end up loving it! <br /><br />But its been many years since I picked up this book myself. Stumbling upon your review brought all those happy memories I've associated with reading this book back. Its so insightful and so beautifully written. I'd say great job but quod erat demonstrandum.
