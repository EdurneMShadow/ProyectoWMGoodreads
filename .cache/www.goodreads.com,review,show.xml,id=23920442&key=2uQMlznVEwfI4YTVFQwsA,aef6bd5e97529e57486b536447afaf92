  <description>&lt;b&gt;About three things I was absolutely positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Edward was a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there was a part of him—and I didn't know how dominant that part might be—that thirsted for my blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first book of the Twilight Saga, internationally bestselling author Stephenie Meyer introduces Bella Swan and Edward Cullen, a pair of star-crossed lovers whose forbidden relationship ripens against the backdrop of small-town suspicion and a mysterious coven of vampires. This is a love story with bite.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[okay so not everyone is going to like them and that's alright. But if you don't like the book say you don't like it in 3 sentences. No one needs a novel on how horrible you think the book is. most people are probably not as passionate about what they read as you are and there is nothing wrong with that. There are thousands of books out there meant for all types of people you just weren't meant to read twilight...obviously!! Maybe you should write your own book if you think you can write something better(and I mean that in a good way ;) ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<p><i>"...if you don't like the book say you don't like it in 3 sentences...."</i> Let me firstly tell you, <b>Gina,</b>, that this statement of yours made me laugh so hard I almost fell off my seat. Don't get me wrong; I just found it funny. I just found you funny. Do you realize that the review part of Goodreads is actually for reviews of books? For criticism? For critique? For concrit - or whatever else you want to call evaluation? I didn't write a freakin' <i>novel</i> (I leave that to Meyer), I wrote my <i>critique</i> of Twilight. I don't see anything wrong with that. You ask me to put everything in three sentences? Well, let me tell you that I can put everything in <b>one</b> sentence: <b>Twilight sucks big time.</b> Is that fine with you? Honestly, that's not fine with me. That one freakin' sentence is called bitching, and not critiquing. I don't <i>think</i> Twilight is horrible; I <i>know</i> it, because I've read it and dissected it. I even elaborated on its weak points.</p><p>And another thing: It's not about me. It's about Meyer, and about Twilight. I already know what I can do. </p>]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Nice Hilaire! Honestly, if you don't like hearing it, don't hear it! I don't read reviews of people who hate The Gemma Doyle Trilogy because I know I will get pissed. That's my logic. And though you did say it in a nice way, your not going to change people's opinions. I'm much more involved with books I love than with books I hate. So please don't come up with the argument that I don't have a life okay? But thanks for saying it nicely. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I completely agree with your review of this book! <br /><br />Twilight was quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. Granted, I'm not part of the "target audience", but I can't imagine that my 15-year old self would have had anything nice to say about this book either.<br /><br />To those of you who felt that Hilaire's review was "too long", perhaps you should think about the point of goodreads. It's a place to exchange ideas and discuss &amp; critique books. There is nothing more frustrating that a review that says. "I loved this book" or "This book sucked." Well, WHY did you love/hate this book? <br /><br />It was also stated that maybe "Twilight" wasn't meant for Hilaire. How on earth is she supposed to know that UNTIL SHE READS IT? <br /><br />Hilaire - I'm curious; did you read any of the other books in the "Twilight" series? I couldn't bring myself to do it. If you did read them, did they get any better?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Haha loved your review.<br />There's a comic strip I found that basically summarizes the entire book:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://shinga.deviantart.com/art/Head-Trip-Twilight-Sucks-85504254" rel="nofollow">http://shinga.deviantart.com/art/Head...</a><br />I keep remembering how Meyers kept trying to portray Bella as being 'smart' <br />Adding bits about her being in Honors Biology, studying Shakespeare...<br />That one scene where she and Edward were the only two students capable of identifying the different phases of mitosis in a white fish blastocyst annoyed the heck out of me (err..how many pages did Meyer drag on about that?)<br />Wtf...the majority of people in my tenth grade biology class had no problems with it after like one class learning mitosis<br />After continuously seeing image after image of the different phases, isn't it abnormal for a class of 11th grade students not to know the difference between, say, interphase and telophase?<br />And wth did her dad do to her that was so atrocious that she can't even refer to him as 'Dad'?<br />And all those petty details that contribute nothing to the plot...(e.g. Bella making a burrito for herself...was that an attempt to suggest independence and maturity? Haha I must admit the contradictions in this book are quite amusing)<br />I want to stab the die-hard Twilight fans who claim that the book deserves a Pulitzer<br />The day that happens, I will completely lose my faith in humanity]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Tracy: It's definitely Stephenie Meyer. As much as I try to, I wouldn't be able to write something as horrible as Twilight. Not in a million years.<br /><br />BTW: I'm updating my critique, everyone. Check out my blog for the edits. I can't post it here; Goodreads doesn't allow... more than 12000 characters, I think.<br /><br />Thanks to Jiwon for the link. It was fun reading. :D<br /><br />]]></body>

I'm impressed that you even finished the book I couldn't get past the part where Bella finds out why Edward can't go out in the sun. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I was really tempted to put down this book half way, but perservered because the friend who lent it to me said it was amazing, and people kept going on about it, so I thought it had to get better eventually. Man, I was wrong, lol. I guess teenagers will like it, and if it makes them read, that's good. But your review is exactly how I felt about it. I thought we would have another Harry Potter, but this was beyond disappointing. Which is a shame, because some of the ideas are pretty cool. She just can't write or develope them it seems.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[-bows down to the greatness-<br />You. Are. My. Hero.<br />I absolutely cannot agree more. Although I disagree with the whole all tennagers like this book. I'm 16 and I think it was badly written and there was just no real point other than they fell in love. And I also found it almost insulting because, like you say, it gives teen girls all the wrong ideas about life. I've seen it first hand due to the fact that I walk through the halls of a high school where every other person has one of the series' books in their hands. My life does not revolve around my boyfriend, as much as I love him, and I have plans to go to college and do something with my life besides frolic around madly in love. A classmate in my AP ENGLISH COMPOSITION class said, and I quote, "You have to read it. Twilight is life!" Yeah, if this is your idea of good reading and life, maybe you shouldn't be in a college level English class.<br /><br />]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I really enjoyed your review. I finished the book a bit ago and I feel like vomiting everytime I think of the prom chapter (not to mention the rest). I admit I did think the book had a lot of potential when I began reading it and up until page 200 or so I did keep on hoping, but it was further down the hill from then onwards.<br /><br />Oh and English is not my 1st language so apologies for any mistakes. I chose to read the book in english but I cannot assess its writing quality like you all can. I can say I did not feel it was horrible but not one of the best I've read neither. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Well - its not the greatest literature is it? Its not even the greatest story ever written. It isnt even well written to be honest. However - Meyer does throw in some interesting ideas:<br />Vampires living amongst humans<br />Living off animal blood not human<br />Another take on how they behave<br /><br />Why not? Its food for thought. Can you do better? It is very easy to criticise - put your money where your mouth is and re-write a bit and see how well you do!<br /><br />Bella. Hmm. I know a Bella or two. Strange geeky semi intelligent girls - and she wouldnt be the only 17 year old to not know what she wanted out of life or what she wanted to do with it. I didnt at 17.<br /><br />Its an okay book, written for girls really. New Moon I agree is sooooooooo long winded I skim read it.<br /><br />The 4th Book, Breaking Dawn was overly long and padded out - granted. But the last third is a great story - and the book I want to read is what happens after that last third of Breaking Dawn.<br />Then you would have a story.<br /><br />Is Meyer the one to tell it? Probably not.<br />But as you are so gifted... what about you? :-)))]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Lol!!<br /><br />I'm guessing you arent female because me being female and all if some guy looked like he was encrusted with diamonds - well, just dont get in my way is all I can say!<br />You think thats a lame idea though - having skin that sparkles in sunlight? But, isnt it so that fiction is all about challenging the accepted mores in life?<br />How do we know that vampires LIKE being vampires? Why can it not be that they dont always like being what they are and want to be like the rest of humanity? And if it IS fiction, then why not fabulous looking vampires with amazing eyes and skin, and with the type of powers that we as humans would love to have but dont seem to possess - except in the very few - like me for instance ! :-)))<br />So, is it lame to just challenge - in fiction - that which has been accepted as far as vampires are concerned? Funnily enough we actually know a few people, none of them connected, that look like the Cullens do in the film. Now, is it lame to be thinking 'wow. She was odd. I wonder........' Just what if they did live amongst us - you with the over active imagination - and we didnt know it. Doesnt it just get you to thinking hmm?<br />But I will grant you that she wrote the book like a breathless inexperienced teenager and that if it werent for the film with the visual aspects to refer to, ergo the rather hot Mr Cullen in the form of one Mr Pattinson, then perhaps it might not have been quite so successful. And I must admit though it pains me to do so, that I have held back from reading The Host by Meyer because I am not sure I am ready for another dose of love sick breathless teenager.<br />THAT said. Twilight will remain one of my guilty pleasures whilst at the same time acknowledging its not exactly high brow literature!!!<br /><br />Where do you hail from Hilaire. I like your style.<br />I'm in the UK. A rather wet and windy UK at the moment.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This review made me and my bro laugh our heads off! I can just read this and know the plot! I've only read the first book and felt my brain turning to mush. Bella definitely needs a back-bone and braincells... Do you know where they do surgeries for that?<br /><br />Anyway, I agree with everything you said, I might as well go to my review and write, 'Go to HIlarie's review.'<br /><br />And Tutti, you can tell me to go to heck, but it's not going to make me change my opinion. Telling people you disaree with to go to heck is low class anyway. I don't judge people who like Twilight, let alone tell them to go to heck. <br /><br />By the way, it seems that the people who are insulting others because they don't like Twilight, don't have a large a volcaubulary. Honestly, can you come up with better words to support your side than just 'twilight rox' or "Twilight Rules"? And insulting others by saying 'twilight is better than ur stupid, idiot, horrbile face' or telling them they're 'freaks', just makes you look bad, it makes Twilight look worse.<br /><br />And since I don't like Twilight, allow me to predict what you will tell me, "go to heck". <br /><br />Okay then, I better start packing for a wasted trip because the devil will kick me out for being so wise and intelligent. I guess I'll be going to heaven.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hilaire, your review is awesome. Granted, I have never read Twilight(the movie was OK), but I have read a YA book about a retart and a supernatural stalker- a la Becca Fitzpatrick. And all I can say currently is- if this many people are writing long, detailed, funny as heck negative reviews, then Twilight must SUCK. So I wish that you would stop me from reading it, because I have an irrational urge to load up on crappy YA books, and this is on the top of my list.]]></body>
