  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Honestly, I think that Gale and Katniss should end up together. He was her first love. Not Peeta. Peeta may be charming and all, but you got to remember, Katniss has known Gale longer than Peeta. Gale has taught her the ways of the forest(and her dad). But the real thing is that she actually felt something when Gale kissed her. She said that she only felt something when Peeta kissed her twice. I understand that it would hurt Peeta's feelings, but you have to remember the fact that their love was partly forced (on her part) and that Peeta might just love her because he's lonely. :( I just hope that Gale and Katniss end up together, and Peeta is just another important character. &lt;3 :)]]></body>

I didn't read anything about that "warm-inside" feeling that she had with Peeta. :)<br /><br />If I was in her place, between old friend and the new guy, I'd probably be just as confused as she is. So, we'll see how it goes. I really think she'd be happier with Peeta. But either way, I can guarantee that it's going to be a fantastic book. :)]]></body>

Peeta deserves to be with her! I think Katniss really does love Peeta even though it's pretend for the cameras, she really does. Peeta doesn't love her because he's lonely. I understand what Peeta goes through with love at first site when he was 5, I got basically the same thing when I was 8. He needs to be with Katniss!!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Aaminah wrote: "I love your review, it summed up perfectly how this book made me feel.

I thought it was amazing, but I just about hate the fact that I could enjoy it so much. I'm still not sure about my rating for it...I'll probably keep it at five, but I just have so many conflicting emotions on this one. <br />I don't think I've ever been so torn up about a book. :/ The ending was great, but I really do feel like there just wasn't nearly enough happiness to counteract all the sadness. And I know there wasn't supposed to be. <br />My heart just hurts over it all.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Well, it's certainly never said that war shouldn't have been fought. <br /><br /><a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[In the end, Katniss' children are able to live in safety, and I think that's supposed to say that the reason they fought the war was for that very purpose. Not that they shouldn't have fought. But that there are certain reasons for a war worth fighting.  <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br />I think you have to decide for yourself whether you believe it was worth it or not. In my opinion it <i>was</i> worth it, in the end. But it was very painful.<br /><br />I do think that it's also saying that someone so young as Katniss shouldn't be so closely involved in a war like that. Honestly, I think Katniss was messed up at the beginning of the third book. Hiding in closets and all. She sort of lost herself when Peeta was taken away, in my opinion.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thanks! Yeah, when I was about 3/4 of the way into the book I thought, "The ending is going to be TERRIBLE!" Because I just couldn't think of any conceivable way for it to end at all happily. I was really pleased with it, though. Collins did a great job giving us a happy-yet-not-happy ending. It fit just right. :)]]></body>

I wonder myself how people could expect a happy ending because I was prepared for way worse and I feel none of the books are very hopeful or happy and you are right there is no way this could have ended better.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I love this review. It really did sum up the book. I didn't know quite how to put into words what I felt throughout the book, and I guess you got that spot on. <br />While I was reading it, I'm sure multiple people questioned my sanity, because I just got SO worked up over what was going on. I would have to put the book down and walk away multiple times. But I kept going back to it, because I HAD to know what happened.<br />I always say that I want a novel without a happy ending, but now that it's been delivered...I take my wish back. <br />So thanks for the review, and for putting into words what I'm sure many people could not. :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA["Happiness was there in the end, but it just wasn't enough to compensate for all the sadness. Then again, I think that was the point."<br /><br />(and from your comment to someone else:)<br /><br />"The ending was great, but I really do feel like there just wasn't nearly enough happiness to counteract all the sadness. And I know there wasn't supposed to be. My heart just hurts over it all."<br /><br />I definitely, definitely feel this way. I just finished it last night, and woke up with a headache, so it'll take awhile for me to process and digest it all. But I had to finally read what others were saying, and you so perfectly summed up how I felt in the end.]]></body>

I think my rating would have been a 4, just because there were so many things I wanted to be there that weren't...but the ending brought it up to a five for me. I felt like it deserved it, because the series was wonderful, and this was the right ending for this kind of series. :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hope you have beautifully conveyed the same feelings which I had at the end of the book and the shocking part I think is the reality of the ending. I was hoping Peeta would go back to normal and everything would be okay but I hit a certain point in the story where I knew it just wasn't possible. The characters are too based in reality to have a rainbows and sunshine ending. I think the epilogue greatly reflects this as well. All I could think of though after I finished it was, "What a tragic life they all lead" They'd already been forced into leaving their childhoods behind even before going into the Hunger Games and it just got progressively worse because they were used for their noteriety and were ultimately as expendable to the rebels as they were to the capitol. I think this would be brilliant book for any high school english or SOSE curriculum. FIVE STARS because it was honest storytelling and we don't always get that in books because let's be honest we don't always want it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hope, <br />I don't know you, but that was a PERFECT way to convey how I feel about this book. I agree with everything you wrote. Everything I felt and am still feeling. I sat up awake several times awake last night thinking about all of it. I love how you say that this is not an antiwar book, but we need to consider when war is a must. That is a hard point to come to. I am not an eloquent writer, so it is hard to put my feelings into words. I thank you for saying and writing what I could not. I am also so tired emotionally from the depths of this book ;) And she is with who I thought she should be with! I am so happy for at least that.]]></body>

It's so nice to know that there are many others who felt the same way. :)<br /><br />@Shannon: Thanks. :) I guess the thing about this book is that in the end, we realize that the war and the loss actually was worth it. For the future generations. <br />I can't put it any better than the great Ronald Reagan did...<br />"Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free." <br /><br />P.S. I'm happy for that last bit, too. She is definitely with who she ought to have been with. :) ♥]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[It's interesting, I honestly didn't know WHO she'd end up with. I had equal likes and dislikes for both boys...and I was in a way shocked at the end (thinking she'd go the other way), but then the more I thought about it the more I realized that it was the right choice in the end. And it's interesting the clues leading up to it that I didn't much catch on to when reading it the first time.]]></body>
