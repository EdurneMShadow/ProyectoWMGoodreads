  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn't doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife's head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media--as well as Amy's fiercely doting parents--the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he's definitely bitter--but is he really a killer? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn't do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Ha, I've been waiting to see someone rip into this. I've figured with the marketing and mass availability of this book it was one of those 'make me into a movie' books. Is this just a 'ripped from the headlines' but 'with a shocktastic twist' books, I mean, didn't this sort of thing just happen to that one woman. I'm blanking on the name but the premise sounds like something that just happened not long ago.<br /><br />SNARKTASTIC. Awesome.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[It's one of those "man bad, woman good (if only by comparison)" books that make me want to vomit bile and swing an axe at the authoress. Because the people in it are vile, and venal, and I wanted all of them to die before uttering another sentence. Becuase at every turn, the easiest choice was the one the authoress made, and it resulted in a cheap, brummagem travesty of a thriller.<br /><br />I didn't want to go and get citations for these points, so I didn't put this in the review itself, but the reasons I hated it so much were founded in actual, writing-based problems with the text, and with the lock-step man dislike that a sizable contingent of woman writers display, apparently Flynn among them.<br /><br />Here's a test to apply: Change the author's gender, reverse the characters' roles, and then tell me the book isn't a sexist nightmare.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[@Richard - Not sure you read the book properly? It was very clear to the reader that, while Nick did have his faults and was a pretty shitty husband, Amy was a complete fucking sociopath and way more dangerous/harmful than him. I don’t see how Amy was remotely “good” in comparison to Nick. She was a hundred times worse, and the author made that quite clear. Obviously Amy’s chapters made her seem like a saint and a victim, because they were written from her point of view – but if you take two seconds to think about it, you realize how crazy she is.]]></body>

If you want to discuss my decoding skills, we're going to have a problem.<br /><br />I understand that Flynn was using unreliable narrators as her device.

Plenty of horrible people get away with awful things, but that doesn't make them any less horrible. She saved Nick's semen and became a mother in order to trap him into the marriage - but nowhere does the author imply that this is acceptable, or okay, or that we should side with Amy. I'm not sure why you're under the impression that this is the message that the reader is supposed to take from the book, because Amy is very obviously a twisted, manipulative sociopath.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[She certainly is. We know that, and Nick knows that...Amy is, however, unaware of her evil, and her attitude isn't in any way a problem for her, and yet there's Nick...too weak to get away? Too cowed? Too...?<br /><br />My problem is with Amy, of course, but also with Nick's portrayal as a lyin' sack of it. In the name of nuance, or something, the man can't be done wrong by the woman. He has to be wrong, too. This is extremely not the case in the bajillions of books NOT by Flynn that use a sociopathic man as a villain.<br /><br />At any rate, I've devoted more keystrokes to this book that I did not like than to huge numbers that I did. Thanks for being so interested in one little negative review of this blockbuster of a book. I feel less like a gnat on a hippo's nose than I did before.]]></body>

If I'm getting this straight, you're irritated because Flynn is writing about a marriage in which both parties are shitty people (albeit one more so than the other), as opposed to one person being "bad" and the other being "good"? I'm no expert, but the former seems far more nuanced than the latter.<br /><br />I'm interested in your review, I'll admit, because your ire seems completely misplaced - as if your gripe is really with those dime-a-dozen mystery/thriller novels where the husband/boyfriend is an abusive stalker, etc.]]></body>

One cannot, you see, ever have a negative opinion that is not The Received Wisdom. I get snapped at "in good fun" for detesting Dickens' sappy, treacly crap...only it's not in good fun, it's "I'm right and you're wrong and I'm going to bait you about it until you don't say things I don't agree with anymore."<br /><br />The particular perp of that nastiness is also in the Group Read of <i>The Master and Margarita</i>, which I chose not to participate in because of him. I simply don't want to hear his mouth about anything at all ever, so it's easiest just to remove myself from the conversation.]]></body>
