  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with this review. I thought that she rushed the ending... this is a spoiler by the way... and how at the end it's like, 'hm, I guess we should just send Gale off somewhere else and say 'okay. I choose peeta." Lissette, the message of the book??? There was tons of message about rebelling against the capitol and not giving up on Peeta and things like that, but she didn't pull through with it. For instance, the main character didn't DO anything, the group with the main characters that you were sure was going to go and beat Snow ended up all dying. Except three, who got there just in time to see Coin win the war withing a page or two. I was disappointed because the other books were so good.]]></body>

How disappointing for me to discover that there was only ONE point in Mockingjay, and that I apparently MISSED it! :)<br />I love goodreads- this is so much fun to have book club discussions with strangers in the middle of my day! And Collins does deserve much acclaim for her excellent and original ideas. Lissette, glad this was a satisfying conclusion to the series for you.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I completely disagree with you. I think you wanted romance and happily ever after. The book is not romance. It's about war. I think the first two books did not express the cruelty that Panem represents. Mockingjay was an amazing young adult book (an amazing book period actually). It was a book about revolution and death. There can be no neatly wrapped happy ending. I applaud Suzanne Collins for knowing that the story is more important than reception.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I gave this book 4 stars, but I did so because if I didn't think it was good I wouldn't have finished reading it in 2 days. <br /><br />However, I was so conflicted because, like you I was disappointed in how she ended it. I also agree that the ending felt so rushed and I didn't see the point of some things in the book. But mostly, I wanted Katniss and Gale to be together, but I saw she was steering the story to end with Peeta. Although I liked Katniss's explanation and it made total sense.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I also disagree with this review. Someone as emotionally damaged as Katniss cannot have a happily ever after. She's loved and lost too many times. What she can have is "as happy as real life gets." The first two books were never about romance either. That was always just another problem for her to deal with, another conflict to get through. <br /><br />But if all you're looking for was romance, go back to Twilight's soap-opera. Not saying it in a mean way. This book is more like Maze Runner, War of the Worlds, 1985. It's like The Empire Strikes Back. Lord of the Rings. Anyway. I'm really pleased with it. :-)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree wholeheartedly. The Gale vs Peeta love triangle seems to have disintegrated by the end. The romance with Peeta was way too much of a plot point throughout these books to be ignored - and the love triangle Collins teased was dropped so easily at the end. And Katniss was so alone - everyone seemed to care (more than realistically expected) about Katniss and her feelings throughout this series, hiding details from her, etc, but when she is torn up and numb they leave her? <br />I have such a hard time picturing this as a YA book. What age group is YA anyway? I have a hard time as a 30 year old "adult" handling the torture scenes and death.<br />So much carnage - Finnick and his Annie reunite - only to kill off Finnick. And why in the world of this book would Prim ever be allowed on the front freakin' lines? They didn't even want Katniss on the front lines - why is her sister there?<br />I understand Collins created a brutal world - and that world at war would be even worse on the body count - therefore I can't truly point out that this or that person should have lived. But that doesn't keep me from being a little disgusted.]]></body>

Coin put Prim on the front lines to die because she knew that would incapacitate Katniss, and she needed Katniss out of the way to consolidate power. <br /><br />This book was never about the love triangle, but If you understood Gale, then it was clear that Katniss could never be with him. He designed the trap that killed the people in the Nut and the bombs that killed Prim. He was a rebel devoted to the cause and Katniss could never be with someone that cold hearted. She had to be with Peeta because he offered her something she's never had: comfort and protection.<br /><br />It's cool if people don't like it though, but the focus of the story was never the love triangle.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I have to say I was surprised by your comment "everyone dies." Really, many of the major characters - Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Haymitch - get out of the book alive. I think it made sense that some of the main characters had to die. This was a war, after all. It wouldn't have made sense if everyone just walked away, free and clear (since you mentioned Twilight, I will go ahead and say - like what happened in Breaking Dawn. That made NO sense. She spends hundreds of pages leading up to worrying about a huge fight, and then the evil vampires come and just back off? Very out of character.)<br /><br />I also think Katniss took her time in coming to terms with her love for Peeta and her relationship with Gale falling apart. Throughout the book, you see her clutching the pearl, and although she doesn't confront Peeta directly right away, I think her actions spoke the loudest. Meanwhile, she and Gale seemed on edge the whole time. I thought it made sense (and I don't think the love story was the central plot - more of a subplot.)<br /><br />That being said, I totally respect your opinion, and I'm sorry that you were disappointed in the book. I'm just planning on writing a spoiler-free review so I wanted to comment on someone else's review.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Shaun wrote: "It's cool if people don't like it though, but the focus of the story was never the love triangle."</i><br /><br />I think your comment is spot on Shaun. The romance is a nice addition to the story. Collins probably knows that romance will drive readership. But this book was about power, justice, and compassion. The characters were wonderful; their decisions and actions consistent throughout the book. I can't see why people who read the first two books wouldn't love this one.]]></body>

The romance is a nice addition to the story...."</i><br /><br />I honestly think it's hard to love book three because it holds a mirror up to all the worst parts of ourselves. Because there's no real happy ending, there's no catharsis. For three books, we've had it shoved in our faces that humans are brutal, cruel, petty, and mean. A happy ending would mean letting ourselves off the hook. It would mean we could tell ourselves that it all works out in the end. But sadly, it doesn't all work out in the end for Katniss the same way it doesn't all work out in the end in real life. And I think that's why some people are bummed out. I felt like the ending was realistic and true and perfect. But it's also a tough pill to swallow. You walk away with only the seeds of hope but with no real redemption. No one is absolved of their sins in the book and that makes it tougher for readers to absolve themselves of their own sins. Collins' message is tough. Humans are a stupid, ridiculous species that probably doesn't deserve to live but her hope, and our hope, is that we learn our lessons before we obliterate ourselves.]]></body>

I gave it 4 stars because I still think she did a fantastic job writing it....until the end. I didn't quite care who she ended up with, just curious how Collins would pull it off, and I wasn't impressed.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with Sally. These books were never really about the romance. It was so extremely frustrating to me that anyone would expect a girl that young to pick the one and only love of her life at such a young age. I hated that the boys pushed so hard on her to choose. She was too young to worry about things like marriage, babies, a war. That was the point that should have been made]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I came to respect Suzanne Collins more because of Mockingjay. She wasn't afraid to stay true to life and to herself even if it meant that a lot of her fans would be disappointed. To be honest, I think I would've liked the book less if Finnick and the other didn't die and not because I hate them. I actually adore Finnick, Prim and Boggs. They’re deaths weren’t in vain as it seems because it sends the audience a deeper message. Prim's and Bogg's death represented the thousands of innocent lives that are taken in war. While Finnick's symbolized any soldier at the same time father/husband that never made it back home to their family. It's heartbreaking but realistic. That's what Suzanne wanted to go for. So that the readers/ the next generation may realize that war does not do any good and thus preventing it from happening. THAT IS ONE OF THE MANY MESSAGES. The love triangle was nicely played out for me. I disagree that she chose Peeta just because he was the only one left. From the very beginning, it was shown that Katniss indeed needs Peeta. She broke down every so often because of him; she missed him, she needed him because no one else seemed to understand her. Not even Gale and that's why they argued a lot. You could see them drifting apart. Prim's death only made it more final. I mean I would be unforgiving too if the person right in front of me planned the trap that killed your sister. We all know Katniss loved Prim very much. Katniss isn’t perfect nor is she the heroine type that always does the right thing like forgiving someone. She is just like us who has flaws and grudges. Peeta's hijacking coincided with the theme of the story- In a war, no one is left undamaged even the kindest people. I never thought it was possible but I loved Peeta even more when he was hijacked because even though he was hijacked he managed to fight it and regain himself. Even if he didn’t trust Katniss, he still saved her from killing herself. That makes him strong. Broken pieces can still be made whole but there will be cracks in it that can never disappear. That's true to Peeta and Katniss- two broken people. I admit the ending seemed rushed to me too but I think that's because healing takes time. If she were to write their rehabilitation time, the book would probably be a thousand pages more. Also, I think she didn't write it in detail because our imaginations are supposed to fill the gaps left. In short, this isn't a book meant for fairytale endings and I loved it. It’s a pity you didn’t like it but I respect your opinion as I hope you will respect my opinions too.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Oh I forgot, Katniss was clearly depressed about the deaths of the members of her squad as she took the time to mention them. She simply didn't have the time to mourn for them because the living needs her to be sane. It also possible that she had no more tears to shed because of all the things she lost. Finnick's death was sudden but that's just how it is when in battle. Not everyone's death is epic. They had a mission to complete under pressure/stress. :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[it was almost the opposite of twilight syndrome for me, breaking dawn was this overly neat, nothing goes wrong book so that all of her characters can be happily ever after. Collins wrote the finale like this "everybody dies, get over it." unacceptable, if i wanted to read that i can read the newspaper. i agree with your review.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Absolutely. No one cares that Katniss is sad. She's not the only one to lose a love to the capitol by any means.<br />I really loved Cinna, but he never was fleshed out, and for that I'm pretty mad. Same with the Avox girl, Bonnie and whoever her friend was, and about a jillion other minor characters...<br />Mockingjay was just so disappointing.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>BumbleBee wrote: "I completely disagree with you. I think you wanted romance and happily ever after. The book is not romance. It's about war.

I wanted to see Katniss get up on her hind legs and fight back. I wanted MORE war in the last book. Instead, Katniss becomes a pathetic mess who doesn't do anything to protect her people.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Could not agree more! It seemed like she was halfway through the writing the book, then just gave up. She spent one little paragraph on the second to last page to tell us who she picked. Not a whole chapter. One SMALL paragraph! I think Collins' fans deserve more then that! Plus it just felt like she settled for him. I hate that she just wrapped it up. I'm hoping the movie could do a better job.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I 100% agree with this review. It was like Collins realised that she had a deadline to hand the script in and just rushed the last few chapters, bypassing all the buildup and character development of the first two books. Such a shame as Katniss had the potential to be a great heroine, regardless of the love triangle, but instead she just becomes a shell of who she was and only gets 'better' over the last two pages of the book]]></body>
