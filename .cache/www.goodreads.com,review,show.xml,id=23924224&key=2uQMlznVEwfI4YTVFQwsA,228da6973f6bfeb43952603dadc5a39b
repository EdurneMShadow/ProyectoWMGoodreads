  <description>Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and inspiring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids. Along the way he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles along the way. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.</description>

Just read 3 or 4 of those and you've basically read The Alchemist.<br />]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Amanda wrote: "...this is just The Purpose Driven Life dressed up with a little fable."</i><br><br>Here's a Taoist parable: <blockquote>An old farmer had worked his crops for many years. One day his horse ran away. Upon hearing the news, his neighbors came to visit. "Such bad luck," they said sympathetically. "We'll see," the farmer replied. The next morning the horse returned, bringing with it three other wild horses. "How wonderful," the neighbors exclaimed. "We'll see," replied the old man. The following day, his son tried to ride one of the untamed horses, was thrown, and broke his leg. The neighbors again came to offer their sympathy on his misfortune. "We'll see," answered the farmer. The day after, military officials came to the village to draft young men into the army. Seeing that the son's leg was broken, they passed him by. The neighbors congratulated the farmer on how well things had turned out. "We'll see," said the farmer.</blockquote><br><br>Is this a parable for the Anti-<i>Purpose Driven Life</i>? Just accept what you get? Or does it advise us to avoid categorizing and attaching a specific meaning to things.<br><br>Like that optical illusion. Is this a young woman or old woman? <br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1379790278i/534081.jpg" width="100" height="150" alt="description" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><br>Perhaps The Alchemist is a story about not letting a stranger come along, getting you stirred up, and compelling you to go look for pyramids. I'm not saying it is, that's the point. Like the optical illusion, sometimes it is not necessary to nail something down to one thing. Is especially true with fables and poems that seem to withstand the test of time.]]></body>

However, I think fables, parables, and obvious "moral of the story" narratives just don't appeal to me because I'm more of a "get to the point" kind of person. I can see the charm they hold for others, but they just never quite work for me.]]></body>

I figured there were enough positive reviews out there that it needed a bit of a counterbalance for readers like me who were expecting one thing and got another. <br /><br />I like your point about burying your cynicism. I readily admit that I'm cynical by nature, so these types of narratives and I don't mix. I'm glad I read it just because now I know what the fuss is about, but, alas, I can't say that I enjoyed it.]]></body>

You should try it..."<br /><br />And you've proved my suspicions correct. For that I thank you.]]></body>

Different people have different tastes. When I find readers who have similar preferences, their positive and negative reviews help guide my decisions. People like me aren't going to like the book, but I also acknowledge that not everyone is like me. I don't begrudge anyone their love of the book, nor should they begrudge me my hatred. Besides, it balances out the gazillions of positive reviews out there!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with your review, and might I also add that your review was written so well! Here I am giving a review on your review. Your review made me laugh, cheered me up because everyone seemed to love this book except me, and it flowed so perfectly with what I was thinking! I couldn't have written a better review if I tried! Well done! You should get into writing if you haven't yet. It might be your calling. All of nature will conspire for your good luck and fortune! :)]]></body>

I hadn't thought about the similarities between <i>The Alchemist</i> and <i>Life of Pi</i> before, which is interesting because they are similar but I infinitely preferred <i>Pi</i>. I think perhaps because it didn't seem quite as preachy and left the moral up to interpretation by the reader.]]></body>

I found the so called message of this book to be trite to the point of uselessness. Plus the characters were uninteresting, the language was sparse, and the conclusion was rather unsatisfying.<br /><br />Your review is spot on and I wonder why more people (the anti-haters if you will) seem to miss the salient points oyu raise.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Mel wrote: "Amanda, wonderful that you could read and review a book, and such a beloved book at that, then go on to ignite such fervent discussion! I'll keep my views on the book to myself, but admire that you..."</i><br /><br />Thanks! I'm never certain as to why some people take a review with an opposing viewpoint as some sort of personal affront. There have been many who have adored books I hated or hated books that I loved, and I'm always fascinated with the way in which books trigger different responses in different people. If someone loves a book, then that experience was clearly very special to them and I'm happy they had it but it doesn't necessarily mean every reader will have a similar reaction. <br /><br />As for the pictures, I have a terrible time with those. My coding knowledge is limited to that little box to the right of the review space. Sometimes I can get it to work, sometimes not so much.]]></body>
