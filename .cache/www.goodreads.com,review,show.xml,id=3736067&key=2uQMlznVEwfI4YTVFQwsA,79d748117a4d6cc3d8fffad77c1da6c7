  <description>&lt;p&gt;History and fiction merge seamlessly in Tracy Chevalier's luminous novel about artistic vision and sensual awakening. Through the eyes of sixteen-year-old Griet, the world of 1660s Holland comes dazzlingly alive in this richly imagined portrait of the young woman who inspired one of Vermeer's most celebrated paintings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <body><![CDATA[I felt the same way, though, that the characters didn't emerge into something different than what they were when the story started. And a huge letdown for me was absolutely nothing remarkable happened during and after Vermeer was painting/painted Griet; I wished there was more.<br /><br />But nevertheless, I gave this book five stars because it felt personal to me. I had an unexplainable connection with this book; I couldn't put that into words.<br /><br />Great review, though! :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[@Tena. <br />I don't think Kate was being negative. We all have our own opinions on books so it really is irrational for you to impose your opinion on her just because you disagree. I also didn't like Chevalier's pitiful writing. It didn't have enough descriptions to show that the book was about art and it mainly discussed about the idiotic Greer and her over-the-top obsession with her master, which didn't make much sense. It all came down to one painting and there was no suspense, except for some baseline bitchiness between her and the wife. You might not agree, but that's how I saw it and please respect that.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I can't disagree with this. However, I rated it with 5 stars 'cause it's been the first book in a long long time that was light, if I can say that, and 'cause the plot was catchy. The characters' development is poor indeed and it made me feel sorry about them- they seem to be all unhappy, dissatisfied..]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Tena wrote: "wow gigi, thanks for your inane comments on my personality since you don't know me. i think you're rude, please respect that."</i><br /><br /><br />Don't be offended. All I was saying was that it was wrong and irrational for you to impose your opinion on someone else because, firstly, everyone is entitled to their own opinion and secondly we are not required to have the same opinion on the matter. <br /><br />If you find me rude, then there's nothing I can do about that. I for one don't care about how I am viewed by a stranger. Just to be clear, if you re read my comment, I did not make any remark against your personality so to find me rude on that basis, especially on something that I had not actually done is rather degrading. <br /><br />Really, my comment was a reply to your view of the reviewer as being "negative" which I totally disagree with. She wasn't being negative; she was saying it how it was and it is HER opinion.<br /><br />Well, thank you for your time.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Gigi, if you re-read MY comment, I didn't say SHE was negative, I said that I didn't think that keeping Vermeer a mystery was negative. You imposed your opinion on me: my comment was not to the reviewer, but to an spect of the novel that she didn't like. I certainly wouldn't call a person I don't know negative. But maybe you should re-read both her comment and mine. No slam was intended toward the reviewer. I mistakenly thought this was a place where we could discuss both the novel and the review. My bad I guess.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Your review closely mirrors my own in many respects. I gave it 3 stars because, having studied European history in the 16th and 17th century I know that Ms Chevalier has done her research and that was one aspect of the novel I found well done. <br />On a point of historical exactitude, it is not possible to say that Ms Chevalier has given us information as to how the painting came about. Griet is a fictional creation, and, for all that is known, the girl could be a servant, equally she could be the daughter of one of Vermeer's friends or patrons. It has been speculated that it may be a portrait of his eldest daughter. Maria, born in 1654, would have been 12 or 13 when the painting was done. And many scholars believe the painting was what is called a <i>tronie</i>. This is a single figure in a painting, not meant to be a portrait, who connotes a specific concept (e.g. old age, piety, youth's bloom etc).

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with Kate's review, although I gave it 3 stars, sue to the fact I could actually finish the book (2 stars) and enjoyed learning more about Vermeer's painting techniques, and like David, the historical aspect (3rd star). I almost abandoned the book near the beginning -- very tedious. The ending was rushed with too many years packed into the final pages.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Loved this book, as I have loved all of Tracey Chevalier's books. A further review would be pointless, since most of you have already written such negative reviews. Hope you all find something you really love.<br />Have you ever read Dickens?]]></body>
