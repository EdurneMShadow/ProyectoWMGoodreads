  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winning will make you famous. &lt;br /&gt;Losing means certain death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, is a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by 12 poorer districts. Early in its history, a rebellion led by a 13th district against the Capitol resulted in its destruction and the creation of an annual televised event known as the Hunger Games. In punishment, and as a reminder of the power and grace of the Capitol, each district must yield one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 through a lottery system to participate in the games. The 'tributes' are chosen during the annual Reaping and are forced to fight to the death, leaving only one survivor to claim victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives. , she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature.</description>

      <![CDATA[So, unlike some reviewers of this book, I was not repulsed by the premise, nor did I think this book was overly graphic or gratuitously violent. Before I commence my review, two things: 1) I am generally a fan of post-apocalyptic struggle-of-the-downtrodden literature, and 2) I am generally a fan...]]>

  <body><![CDATA[This is the best review I've read. I am reading a bunch of reviews because I'm too lazy to write my own. And because while I found this book riveting, I also found it to be just BAD and I can't even explain why. The only thing I can come up with is, it's just poor... such poor writing, such poor character development, inept descriptions and scene setting, etc. There is some amazing literature out there, it's too bad that everyone is hung up on this garbage. I think that's part of why I'm reading all these reviews- I'm reading the negative reviews because I need confirmation that there are still people with good taste left in this world (not to mention brains).]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thanks for your review. So true what you say about wasted characters. I really wanted to know more about the others too. I enjoy dystopian settings, and look for strong female characters, but I don't feel like I really found one here - I'm not sure that killing people in a 'nicer' way than the others and then justifying it to yourself after some token guilt demonstrates real inner strength.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I'm not trying to be mean or anything but The Hunger Games is nothing like twilight I will admit the love triangle is like it. The Hunger Games is about survival and katniss trying to keep her loved ones alive. Twilight is about vampires and werewolves. I agree with you on learning more about the other characters but you have to realize it's in Katniss's point of view. You also have to realize that books will be alike in just the little ways it's not like The Hunger Games is about vampires and werewolves that would be exactly alike. I'm not trying to be all like hating on you but I just wanted to say that.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Awesome review. I enjoyed the book, but I certainly had some issues with it and you summed them up quite nicely.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't quite understand how this book managed to attract such a massive, almost religious fan following in such a short period of time. It's certainly not a bad book, but the stores are putting it on a pedestal like it's the next Harry Potter. I can't even walk into my local Barnes and Noble without tripping over countless shelves of Hunger Games t-shirts, posters, book guides, etc. Perhaps it's the movie?<br /><br />Anyway, great review, and I'm glad I'm not the only one who sees some of the flaws here :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thank you for this detailed review! I've just seen the movie and thought maybe the book does some more explaining on the moral compass on killing children for sport and fun. Especially how the heroine copes with something so cruel. Apparently reading the book is wasted time.]]></body>

Ultimately though, my reviews are about my response.<br /><br />Chris, the odd thing is, even though I rated the book far less highly than you did, that aspect didn't bother me too much. Some people really are that oblivious, especially if they've never had a serious relationship and aren't looking for one.]]></body>

My brain hurts trying to grasp how one could possibly have any sort of attachment toward this broken irrational world, repulsive characters, and catastrophic character and plot development, among a myriad of other serious problems.<br /><br />Yet it somehow is rated an average of 4.4 from 3 million ratings. I just don't... It makes no sense. Thank you for voicing what I'm too exhausted to put into words.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I enjoyed your review. I agree on most part, it was, I think the actual reasons why the target population (teens/schoolkids) loves this book to bits. I'd say it's a difference in preference. Anyone who likes whirlwind romances and love triangles would dig the riveting feelings Katniss has for both love interests. You, and me and the rest of the commentators who agree didn't like the obliviousness that Katniss has so much. More importantly her emotional decisions are used as a compass in the story's direction. It's so annoying while we think of so many interesting endeavours to read in the book. <br />Having said that, I love the movie so much because of the actors and the way it was portrayed. <br />Since we're here for book review, it's not an excellent book that is worthy for all the fangirls/fanboys to hype at.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I disagree. Hunger Games really doesn't have a "love triangle." I mean sure, maybe in the first book she has difficulty deciding who she wants to be with. But in Catching Fire, Katniss realizes that she had a bond with Peeta, over the games and the overall experience, that she could never have with Gale. So basically, in Mockingjay, Katniss loves Peeta and Peeta loves Katniss. And then we have Gale sitting in the corner, wondering what the heck hit him. He still loves Katniss, but she has no feelings for him. So this is not a love triangle. It's more like a love angle. This is one of the reasons I loved the books so much!! The main focus and moral isn't love!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with you on the "wasted potential" and "predictability" counts. I haven't even finished the book, but I have regularly been knowing what will happen subconsciously a couple pages ahead of time. The one thing I really, really thought would be interesting would be if Rue had NOT been conveniently killed off by the Careers, leaving Katniss in a very awkward situation. Cue interesting moral crisis! But no, we had to do the "everything works out pretty well" routine, eliminating complex problems with convenient circumstances. Either way, I think this book is ok, but overrated.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I hear you about the movie. I enjoyed the books myself, for the most part, but I think that's largely because I saw the movies first.<br /><br />Katniss is not terribly likeable, and learning everything through her felt forced. Plus the writing is just plain shoddy. The story itself, though, I appreciate. <br /><br />Everything in Katniss's Hunger Games happens rather conveniently, yes, but I understand that to be part of the idea - it's not Katniss who makes everything happen, she's just caught up in the middle of it all and pushed this way or that as the real players dictate. Maybe exploring her moral culpability would have been one theme too many and detracted from the bigger picture?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I'm sorry, but unfortunately you're wrong about the Twilight thing. I can also see you don't like this book, and that's fine, but Twilight is not as good as THG. The love triangle is practically non-existant. There are also no werewolves/vampires. And the book goes much deeper than what people claim to be a "rip-off of Battle Royale."<br /><br />This is written for 12-13-14-15 year olds. I don't think anyone outside that category can enjoy it as much.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Haven't seen the movies, but I think in many ways the script writer has a much easier time than the original book writer. The setting is already done for him and proven attractive enough, he can simply focus on the details. Throw away the ridiculous (say, Katniss twirling in her dress during the interview) or add some little touch the novel did not think of (say in LoTR, Gandalf's look of relief when Frodo sees no inscription on the Ring but then his "Wait"). It can add up to something surprising.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Even though I love this book, I really enjoy your review. It's an intelligent way to express why the book doesn't appeal to you. You made it about your tastes and opinions, not badmouthing the author or the people who do like the book. I wish more one-star reviews were like yours. Well done.]]></body>
