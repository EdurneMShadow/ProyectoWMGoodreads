  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winning will make you famous. &lt;br /&gt;Losing means certain death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, is a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by 12 poorer districts. Early in its history, a rebellion led by a 13th district against the Capitol resulted in its destruction and the creation of an annual televised event known as the Hunger Games. In punishment, and as a reminder of the power and grace of the Capitol, each district must yield one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 through a lottery system to participate in the games. The 'tributes' are chosen during the annual Reaping and are forced to fight to the death, leaving only one survivor to claim victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives. , she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[I am glad you enjoyed my review so much and that it inspired you to write your own, Nilesh! I agree with what you say. I thought that none of the characters was particularly likeable or relatable, and I was really annoyed by Katniss. Maybe it gets better in the later two books, but I don't think I'll read them, at least not soon. I also agree that the book has gained a following which is almost religious in nature. Maybe the newly released movie will be better than the book?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>In many reviews people come out with most lame excuse (defense) I have ever heard- <b>IT’s A YOUNG-ADULT NOVEL</b></i><br /><br />I hate, hate, hate that excuse. Young Adult novels can still be good and socially valid. Just because they're aimed at a younger crowd doesn't mean they have to be less intelligent or not as good. /rant.<br /><br />I really did enjoy your review. Agreed with you on a lot of it. I am curious to see the movie, and eventually read the other 2 books, but not curious enough to buy them in hardcover.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>But later when she realises that it was her first kill, still she doesn’t reflect over it even for a minute. </i><br /><br />That didn't bother me in the context of the story, because, of course, she is fighting for her life, and people in combat situations do not usually take time to wallow in reflection. You might well enjoy the second book more, when Katniss really does have some time and opportunity to think about what is going on around her.]]></body>

But if you want to see for yourself- go for it, it is very quick read. <br />There is some kind of wave which i don't recognize, first Harry Potter then Twilight now this, God knows what next.

I just wanted to know how she mentally prepared herself from killing rabbit and squirrel to killing human, few lines maybe a paragraph would have done. But all Collins write about is that Katniss like stew, Cinna dresses her beautifully etc. to get sponsor. Sponsors help but they are not going to come to kill the tributes.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I do understand why the book didn't work for you, and I'm sorry, just because I want everyone to love every book they read (and toss the ones they don't).

  <body><![CDATA[Ha, good plan. Taking shelter in the classics is always for the best.<br /><br />I had a professor that said the Lit department had to read Twilight to 'better understand what their students read'. Apparently there is one page that uses the word 'I' over 40 times. From what I understood, its juvenile writing with a sensationalized plot. However, I find it interesting the author had a degree in creative writing and is also a Lit professor. So who knows, maybe it just gets a bad rap. I'll be looking forward to your thoughts when you read it. Maybe I should join in.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[For me, it was kinda like the opposite. The movie was ok, while I thought the book shed more light on Katniss' personality (she's emotionally disconnected, which makes it hard for a 'deeper' descriptions of things - quite like Clay from <i>Less Than Zero</i>. In a way, she is guarded even against her own self because at the core she cares too much - I don't know how to explain this, but I can certainly relate to that kind of feeling). I think some of the views expressed in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8046680.The_Girl_Who_Was_on_Fire_Your_Favorite_Authors_on_Suzanne_Collins__Hunger_Games_Trilogy" title="The Girl Who Was on Fire Your Favorite Authors on Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games Trilogy by Leah Wilson" rel="nofollow">The Girl Who Was on Fire: Your Favorite Authors on Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games Trilogy</a> say it best.<br /><br />Maybe it's because I watched the movie first before reading the series, so at least I could flesh out the characters better (although certain characters like Haymitch and Cinna turned out differently in my mind, since I actually know some people who <i>are</i> Haymitch and Cinna). Certainly if I hadn't watched the movie my views would've been different, since I'm a visual type who need to have a picture of how the main characters and the world look like. <br /><br />Sure the books aren't 'perfect', but when I was reading I wasn't so much as reading it as I was 'in it'. Maybe this was why I overlooked (not intentionally, but by way of being a passenger in the thick of it as opposed to being a calm onlooker) prose, technical issues etc. At one point I stopped judging and instead just feel the story. (Perhaps by virtue of being 'high' or something. I read the whole 3 books as a whole story in about 1 sitting, so yes, not so much as reading but experiencing it). It was an amazing ride for me, hence the 5 stars.<br /><br />PS: sorry for the long rant. I got carried away in the process :p interesting and funny review, by the way! The second movie should bring the set up a notch, I'd say.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Emotionally disconnected? I have never come across a character who is emotionally disconnected, so I have no idea what to expect of such characters. I just felt that katniss portrayed in novel didn't looked realistic. She is just 16 y/o and when she goes to capitol and enter games, she experiences many new and interesting things and herself does many other, but there is no excitement, fear or remorse. This is really irritating because she is the narrator of the story.<br />I also wanted to enjoy the story but I just couldn't, because I had my expectations very high due to its rating and nearly everyone going mad about this book. And I was waiting and waiting and waiting for the point from where it would get really good, in this process the novel ended and I was left staring open-mouthed at the cover thinking, did I read the same book as everyone's. <br />Oh! and what a bad way to end the games or the story.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Not only Katniss but all the characters were shallow and looked like they were made for single purpose, take example of Peeta, whose only job was to love Katniss, and the only characters I liked were Haymitch and Cinna, they were only characters more like real people, maybe because they behaved differently under various circumstances, especially Haymitch. <br />The way movie has been made, it looks likes the makers were expecting that the audience must have read the book first, they escape introducing or explaining few things, somethings will not be too clear for those who have not read the book. I doubt that those who have not read this book will enjoy the movie. And it turned out same with you, but it gave you image of characters.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Oh I did enjoy the movie too. What I said as opposite was about watching the movie before reading the book. Hmm...I'm kinda emotionally disconnected sometimes (or maybe a lot of times. Ive been accused of that) but for the things I feel strongly about, it really is intense. In that sense I can relate to Katniss' decisions. So boys aren't like this? Like I said, Less Than Zero is similar I think. In that book, the protagonist is pretty much nihilistic, yet...the emotion is there. <br /><br />Perhaps expectations do play a part, or people's way of viewing things are simply diverse.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[To me the film was 100x better than the book. It glossed over many of the faults in the book. One of them was indeed the relative emotional inadequacy (I had the feeling that Katniss was autistic in the book) of the protagonist.<br /><br />In the film her character seems to react in the sort of stunned way that one would expect from someone in her situation. In the book, she just seems like a very self-absorbed, almost antisocial personality.<br /><br />Also, the film glosses over the morally controversial aspects of the book, like for instance the lack of reluctance on the part of Katniss and Peta to kill.<br /><br /> (Katniss seems to love killing, and she agrees somewhere that killing humans would be similar to killing the animals that she habitually kills).<br /><br />At the start of the film they do portray this callous aspect of her personality when she wants to shoot the only deer that's been seen around in a year - but at least the complacency Katniss and Peeta seem to feel about killing humans is completely toned down. <br /><br />In fact, in the film Peta doesn't get to kill an innocent girl like he does in the book; and Katniss doesn't want to <a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[shoot Peta like she does at the end of the book.  <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br /><br />I still don't agree with the way in which material like this is presented as material for teens and children to read or view, but at least the film handled a lot of aspects better than the book did.]]></body>

She was killing because that was only way out of the situation, the killing by Katniss has been justified by giving various reason so that to make it clear that she is heroine (otherwise how could readers would have liked her) and other tributes are butcher on rampage.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[The problem is though, that if you set up a character like that in a heroic way, you might find that kids will want to copy her, because she is made to look good in the story, and also, the Hunger Games as an activity is presented in a very glamorous light in both book and film.<br /><br />I didn't read the 2nd and 3rd books, but apparently at least later in the series Collins does make it clearer that the Hunger Games are despicable, and the protagonists rebel against the institution.<br /><br />Still, if you publish books on their own, you are setting up a situation where people are going to judge a series by the first book - if they don't like it, they're not going to read any further, and I must say that I found Collins's writing technique so bad that I can't force myself to continue.<br /><br />Maybe a Sparknotes type summary somewhere might be the answer..]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I have also been trying to figure out what message does YA-novels try to convey to teenagers, such novels are directly targeted at them. And they can be easily influenced and by more 'cool' looking negative aspects of novel. <br />I have read two YA-novels, one is this and other is Twilight. I read Twilight recently, about one month ago and I'm till today struggling to write a review of it. What do people love in it? Bella, who keeps 'stumbling' loves Edward, and Edward is a ****ing over-possessive and 'always chuckling' stalker, what does the story try to tell! That stalking is adorable or something like that?<br />Stephen King said "Harry Potter is about confronting fears, finding inner strength and doing what is right in the face of adversity. Twilight is about how important it is to have a boyfriend."<br />Its either that YA-novels have nothing good to say other than that bad-assery is really 'cool' or I am missing the right message.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Nilesh wrote: "Well, I am having hard time picturing 'emotionally disconnected' person. Can you please explain this thing in terms of Katniss' portrayal in this novel."</i><br /><br />Maybe like traveller said, Collins should've written this as one book rather than set it to trilogy mode. For me I read all of them at once so I regard it as one story rather than 3 books. As for emotional detachment - I'm not expressive in this sense - most things I could care less and people might accuse me of callousness or just being devoid of emotions. But I hardly open myself up to others, either because they don't matter enough, and even in cases when they matter too much (and sometimes even I don't quite understand myself). When I read characters that don't explain every single emotion or justification for something, I relate to that because people's emotions aren't rational and perhaps for some this might be a turn off, but for me at least it felt right. I mentioned Clay from LTZ as comparison because here you have two extremes - Katniss whose foremost thought is survival, so others don't matter (but past surviving they'd start to) and Clay who has everything so everything doesn't matter. Nevertheless, you can still tell where their bearings lie from the choices they make, in a multitude of scenarios. It does take time. Being emotionally detached doesn't mean heartlessness or not understanding emotions (autism, for example) and morals, it's just that there's a gap between expression and feeling. I call it selective feeling. Maybe it's innate, or maybe circumstances shaped this, who knows..some readers prefer more expression of a character's feelings, some are fine with open ended expressions. First person narratives lend themselves greater ease to either being a love it or hate it story. Yes, it's crucial that you relate to (not necessarily agree or like) the narrator for you to like the book. But like people, not everyone you can get along with. There are lots of 1st person narratives that put me off too, although it's my favourite kind of narrative. <br /><br />I've said before, I didn't think and ask questions like a spectator would (in which case the movie would work better because it's presented for that purpose) , but rather I was soaking in the experience and the questions asked were more from the perspective of one on site, and that probably contributed to my enjoying the story. And writing that makes me forget I'm a spectator and allows me to enjoy the story like I did is good in my book.]]></body>

I am not saying that Katniss is heartless, being heartless is also a human aspect. Katniss is unrealistic or unpractical under the circumstances that are shown in the book. <br />I also doubt that Collins made emotionally disconnected character, but it was unintentional writing flaw. And this flaw of poor characterisation is the reason that there are no other memorable characters in this story.]]></body>

For most of the YA I've read after coming across shining reviews from GR I tend to find them a letdown...so far, only those recommended through friends or their reviews actually turned out good.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I found this review incredibly interesting, in its an aspect I never considered because I was able to connect so well to Katniss, in a sense. Katniss lives in a world where everything is different and the fight for survival is on so many fronts its neck breaking. From the games, to life at home, even pure psychological warfare with your own mind. From a young age, Katniss uad to be the one to stand up and take care of her family despite the costs, which lead her to be hard and uncarring. Then the games come around, and now she has to fight to make it, to make sure Prim has someone reliable, has food, etc. It isnt until after the games where everything smashes into her, because now that she isnt fighting for her life, her mind is preoccupied with who she killed and what tried.to kill her. It all made sense to me, how she reacted. However I do feel that it was the overlying story of goverment vs. its people and how it destroys even the most common of human decensies that was supposed to be the main point of the books, not just katniss and her story. <br /><br />I suppose it comes down to ones personal experiences when you look at relateability and any of the.characters actions. This is why I found your review so interesting, its a different perspective and I love that its made me think! (I do love the HG, by the way. I thought.it.was a good series. the best, no. but good.)<br />Thats a bit of my take on it, i apologize for the rambling and any typos, i happen to he on my phone and going back and fixing gramatical errors and.typos is a pain. cheers xx]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I am sorry, Aydia! I somehow forgot to reply. Thanks for taking time to comment and I'm glad that you found my review interesting.<br />I don't want to comment on Katniss anymore, I think my comment would start getting repititive because I have said all I wanted to. Coming to theme of novel, well it was ok for me, had I enjoyed the novel more then I would have been much more impressed by its theme.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I thought movie was better than book, Katniss felt real and there was little more focus on other characters unlike book in which only Katniss ruled. <br />I don't plan to read second book, I don't think YA-novels are for me.]]></body>
