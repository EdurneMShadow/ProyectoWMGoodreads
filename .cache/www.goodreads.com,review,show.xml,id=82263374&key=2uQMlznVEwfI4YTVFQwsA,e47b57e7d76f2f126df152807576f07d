  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[I think your review of this book is dead on. The first in this series was chosen as a nominee for the Illinois grades 5-8 Rebecca Caudill reading award, and the kids love it. However, I am really wondering the appropriateness of Mockingjay in our middle school circulation since it was so much darker and, I felt, gratuitously more violent than the other two.]]></body>

She basically sulked around and thought a lot but that didn't communicate anything. Everyone was addicted to morphine in this book.]]></body>

And Katniss barely even blinked when it happened, so I thought...wait a minute, Katniss isn't sad...maybe Finnick didn't really die and I miss-read...?? But, no, when I went back and read again...dead. NOO! I'm more mad a Collins than Katniss, because, honestly, the person with Katniss's name in this book was just NOT Katniss!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[i just feel like katniss really changed in this book and instead of becoming more independent like most heroines she actually got weaker. which might be realistic, but it's still annoying to read about. <br /><br />...and about the more romance part? yeah. i did really want more romance. i love peeta and i'm really mad at suzanne collins for taking away my last chance to obsess over him. and yes, i'm aware of how pathetic that sounds, but i'm really past the point of caring-kinda like katniss was in most of mockingjay;)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Was completely disappointed by this book! Gave it 1 star...LOL <br />The reason I began to read the Hunger Games series in the first place was the strong Katniss that would never give in to being used! I was really interested as to how she'll handle the rebellion, especially since District 12 was already destroyed. I thought she'd take up the lead in the Capitol's destruction but she just sulked around and played a puppet to both the Capitol and District 13, which was extremely disappointing! It's like a complete slaughter of her character. And it's not just Katniss...It was like all of the characters in the first two books suddenly changed. I couldn't imagine Peeta acting the way he did for the most of the book, it's just sad. And Gale completely leaving Katniss just like that...it wasn't the Gale I expected. <br />Though you could defend the ending by saying it's just a realistic ending to the series, the way it was written just irritated me like how Prim, Finnick and the others were killed. I felt like their deaths were completely useless, and considering how Finnick's already reunited with Annie and all, it just makes his death more irritating than depressing. I was actually confused when they died, thought I just missed the parts where they escaped so I kept rereading those parts. @.@]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Ughh, I feel the same way. Like why the hell did Gale just disappear? and she got to know about him like through a Lady...? and all she was thinking about was that he maybe kissing someone else..ugh then I seriously didn't like the ending of Prim...she was good, mature...but why did they just kill her..and she wasn't even mentioned until she was dead...or consoling her sister that you love Prim.. and Finnick...gosh when he died i feel like kicking someone...why the hell did Collins do that? then why hijacking Peeta...? ugh ugh ugh... I was finally having hope that he will be like the hero or something...but then baammm...no, he just became a mental boy who loves a mental girl...i loved hunger games the best...Catching fire was OK...Mockingjay was OK too..i was like where's Peeta? i want Peeta...and all we got was him being mental...gosh...then Katniss...she became seriously like a mutt..I mean cant she save Peeta? cant she go talk to Gale in the end? In the ending i was crying..not in the epilogue but in the last Chapter when shes like totally mad...but when the book finished...i just stared at the page...i read and read and read again the last few sentences...but they were like...so meaningless...it was like her life was so like not doing anything herself...i feel like punching in her Face when she was not telling Peeta who is she when he became hijacked...i was like SHE DIDN'T even thanked Gale for saving Peeta...if he wasn't there...then there was no Peeta...I loved so many characters...but they just died and died and died...I didn't even sleep.. I was reading this book for 5 to 6 hours whole Sunday morning...i stared at like 11 pm...then finished at 9 am...I was like..no i wont sleep...i want to know the ending...ugh i almost hated Peeta when he started saying "real or no real" she was forced to be with Peeta...in the end she says "What I need is the dandelion in the spring. The bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction. The promise that life can go on, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again.Only Peeta can give me that" it was like she had no choices at all...And last of All...I didn't wanted it to be a trilogy...I wish it ended when they come alive from the game in hunger Games and shes says i love u truly blah blah blah...Gale i am so sorry you can only be my friend...Her family living peacefully at last..and then shes singing... with Peeta on her side and he staring at her...smiling ugh...but no this cant be a peaceful ending...it was liked she was forced to write more about...dragging...ugh...i am soo angry..]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[ok... I have only read about three pages and I got the feeling things were going to be a full blown frustration through this book. So I decided to look at some reviews- which I have strategically avoided so as to not ruin anything about this book I have been DYING to read...<br /><br />I was guessing she didn't end up with Gale. Since she was in love with him in book one but we never saw or got to know him in the first two(kind of like Peris in the Uglies series). <br /><br />I like your review, it matches up with what I was beginning to suspect, and dread. So I will take it as a heads up and maybe not be so disappointed.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I just felt like ripping the book to pieces when I read the part that Finnick had died. He was the only character in this series that i liked from beginning to end so i had to read over that part again just like everyone else. I felt so sad and depressed that I didn't want to read anymore. I'm still so angry at Collins for killing him of like that.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Wow...you took the words right out of my mouth...almost exactly all 5 bajillion of them...including those of Cinna and Finnick...I have been shaking my head all day. This was soooo disappointing. And what about the pearl? I kept thinking the pearl would act as some kind of trigger to snap Peeta out of it and Bam! We have our strong Katniss back, Peeta and his strength and logic...this makes for a super battle and a great ending no matter who dies...but nope...in fact was there really even a battle? She just kinda fainted into the hospital yet again...sigh. Frustrating ending to an amazing series...Thanks for putting into words which I could not...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree the book was sad, and disappointing. I was the same exact way I couldn't wait for this book to come out. When I read it though I realized my expectations were too high The book wasn't awful it just wasn't up to par with the other two. But on the other hand it did keep me interested enough to read into the end and I'm so glad I did or else I wouldn't have read that Peeta and Katniss ended up being together and having kids or that Prim died. So it was a good book just simply not as amazing as the other two.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[So this is a late comment but oh, well. I have to disagree with you. Katniss is still strong but you'd be a little weakened and traumatised if you had seen people die at your hand and if the boy you loved was off getting traumatised. And about how Cinna and Finnick's deaths weren't extravagant and big. THAT'S HOW DEATH IS! Death is sudden and unpredictable and when Katniss didn't shed a tear, she was just like us! Some of us didn't cry because we couldn't believe it. The book is true to the series. It shows the Capitol in it's true colours. Peeta was hijacked, for God's sake. And you're saying that it was stupid how he wasn't himself? He was tortured! I'm not hating on you, I'm just saying that you've really got to think about how and why it's written. Everything is written the way it is for a reason.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with most of the review and the comments. I felt like the book was supposed to show how the two main protagonists are each broken down by power players in the absence of each other. And never fully heal.<br /><br />I thought Peeta and Katniss needed to get together, but their relationship was so bizarre by the end of the book that the ending seemed unrealistic. I'd feel weird if my spouse had tried to kill me on several occasions in the past in fits of insanity. And then for them to have kids together? Both of them are so scarred...they should have had a major crying session in which they apologized for everything, then taken a leaf out of Frodo's book and gone to the undying lands. Their many "weather tops" never fully healed.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree for the most part. I thought he book was going to be five star but it was not as fast passed and it was not as nice of a conclusion as I would have liked. I would have liked if they explained more what happened in the end of the story. I thought there was some good ideas in the story but I thought it was kind of slow paced book and I don't like slow paced books.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Yeah... Totally agree with your review, even as a Gale supporter. Well said. You summed up all the things I couldn't verbalized about why I couldn't stand the ending.<br /><br />Also, I feel like there were potentially some good lessons there at the end, but swallowed up in too much sadness. It's a book that would make sense to those going through depression or pts, but no one wants that to win out...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I totally agree with you. There were too many parts of the book where nothing interesting happened. The others were so full of action, and this one is not nearly as good. I was disappointed when I read Mockingjay . I know Peeta was not in the book as much and I wish he was in it more, but I can see why they left him out more. He was captured and it was supposed to be from Katniss’s point of view. So it would be hard to add Peeta in.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[i agree with you on the parts where u say the deaths were just kinda yeah hes dead. oh well that annoyed me.too. but then i got into thinking and i think the most crucial point of this book is that it feels and is so real (storywise) and i think in such a situation the death of cinna and finnick and prim and... cant be to dramatic because if katniss would let herself fully grieve for all of them and suzanne vollims would give them a dramatic death it would just be to sgattering for katniss and kinda unrealistic as people really just die, mostly very undramaticaly. they die and then u have to move on. I think thats what she was trying to show.<br />lol i hope my babbling up there makes any sense to u..]]></body>
