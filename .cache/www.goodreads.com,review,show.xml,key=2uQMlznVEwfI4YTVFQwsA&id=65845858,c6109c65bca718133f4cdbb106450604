  <description>In Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel's memoir &lt;i&gt;Night&lt;/i&gt;, a scholarly, Orthodox teenager is wracked with guilt at having survived the horror of the Holocaust &amp;amp; the genocidal campaign that consumed his family. His memories of the nightmare worlds of Auschwitz-Birkenau &amp;amp; Buchenwald present him with an intolerable question: how can the god he once so fervently believed in have allowed these monstrous events to occur? There are no easy answers in this harrowing book, which probes life's essential riddles with the lucid anguish only great literature achieves. It marks the crucial first step in Wiesel's lifelong project to bear witness for those who died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Yiddish title: Un di Velt Hot Geshvign/And the World Remained Silent&lt;br /&gt;(Buenos Aires, 1955). Revised as La Nuit (1958) &amp;amp; translated as Night (1960).</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Wiesel came from a long-standing Hassidic family; that is to say, his family and upbringing were deeply religious. He studied in a religious seminary and his immersion in religion was profound. As such, his faith wasn't something he could just shed in a day. For all religious Jews who for whatever reason decide to discontinue their religiousity, there's always a process. And, certainly, in a case like this, the wavering between belief and disbelief would be something that doesn't just happen once and for all.<br /><br />Certainly when you're facing death, with roots as religious as Wiesel's were, it's only natural to turn to the same source you've been turning to all your life, even if a moment ago you were absolutely convinced that He isn't there. I suppose you could say that for a little while longer one has, not so much faith in a God, as the hope for a faith in a God.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[EMIR: You mean reading the book and not my review, right?<br /><br />Me, my eyes did not cry but my heart did. I liked the father and son tandem. I thought that they survived (well the father died in the last camp) because they had each other. But I guess the book is too thin for the characters to become fully developed. Besides, scenes from Schindler's List kept on entering my mind so it lessened my brain's activity. For example, the instruction <i>"Women to the right, Men to the left"</i> was very <i>Schindler's.</i> I know that maybe it really happened or Spielberg and his team based it from this book. Now that remember, I can't recall reading that instruction uttered in Keneally's book. Hmmmm.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[One of my favorite passages, from "The White Hotel" by D.M. Thomas. It articulates so well the significance of ALL writing about the Holocaust.<br /><br />"The soul of man is a far country, which cannot be approached or explored. Most of the dead were poor and illiterate. But every single one of them had dreamed dreams, seen visions, and had amazing experiences, even the babes in arms (perhaps especially the babes in arms). Though most of them had never lived outside the Podol slum, their lives and histories were as rich and complex as Lisa Erdman-Berenstein's. If a Sigmund Freud had been listening and taking notes from the time of Adam, he would still not have fully explored even a single group, even a single person. And this was only the first day."]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[KD, excellent review. You should not feel that you are doing injustice by doing a critique on this literature. A guiding principle among the holocaust victims was that "we must never forget", and that those who survived must spread this information. I am sure that these unfortunate souls would be grateful to know that at a much later time, in a country far away from them or their imaginations, would be taking such an active role in discussing their plight in such a touching manner.<br /><br />I have read and heard Weisel and he is the perfect witness of the Holocaust- along with Primo Levi. I have not read this book, but I certainly shall. As you probably know, I have read many of this genre, some poor representations.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[DAVID: I didn't know that "The White Hotel" is about Holocaust. I have that in my tbr. It has this picture (silhouette) of a naked woman staring at a hotel so I thought it is an erotic book. :)<br /><br />B: You're right. You know that I could be passionate in my reviews as I have the tendency of being carried away by what I read. Remember "Emma"? :) Lesson learned. There are just topics I think I have to be careful about like culture, gender and racial sensitivities. Holocaust books for me feel sacred.<br /><br />SUE: You're definitely welcome! I was holding "The Periodic Table" by Primo Levi (I also have his "Survival at Auschwitz") this morning and I think I will read it later this month. Or maybe "The White Hotel" first. Let's see.<br /><br />Thanks to all for liking my review!]]></body>
