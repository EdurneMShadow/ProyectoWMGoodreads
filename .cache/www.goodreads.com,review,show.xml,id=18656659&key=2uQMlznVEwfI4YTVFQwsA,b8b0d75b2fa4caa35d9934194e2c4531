  <description>&lt;i&gt;Night&lt;/i&gt; is Elie Wiesel's masterpiece, a candid, horrific, and deeply poignant autobiographical account of his survival as a teenager in the Nazi death camps. This new translation by Marion Wiesel, Elie's wife and frequent translator, presents this seminal memoir in the language and spirit truest to the author's original intent. And in a substantive new preface, Elie reflects on the enduring importance of Night and his lifelong, passionate dedication to ensuring that the world never forgets man's capacity for inhumanity to man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Night&lt;/i&gt; offers much more than a litany of the daily terrors, everyday perversions, and rampant sadism at Auschwitz and Buchenwald; it also eloquently addresses many of the philosophical as well as personal questions implicit in any serious consideration of what the Holocaust was, what it meant, and what its legacy is and will be.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Thanks, Abigail. It's just that <i>Night</i> is so famous and 'important' that it somehow seems 'not done' to criticise it...<br /><br />My mother read <i>Gizelle, Save the Children</i> a while ago and was very impressed with it. I hope to read it myself one day. I'd never heard of <i>Fragments of Isabella</i> until you mentioned it, but your review sounds excellent. I'm adding it to my list (...). Thanks for the recommendations!<br /><br />I'm not surprised to hear that a Wiesel-edited encyclopaedia of the Holocaust should neglect to include women. I was seriously shocked at the way he ignored his mother and sisters' fate in <i>Night</i>. The mother and youngest sister get a few token mentions, but the two elder sisters might as well never have existed for all the attention he pays them. Incredible. <br /><br />Just out of curiosity, did you ever come across a book called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/687062.Hidden_Children" rel="nofollow">
  <i>Hidden Children</i>
</a> when you were going through your Holocaust phase? I'm asking because I know two of the 'children' in that book. I've read their chapter of the book, but never the entire thing...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I don't mind fragmentary per se. It's a certain kind of fragmentary that I dislike, especially when combined with other things I perceive as flaws. <i>Night</i> unfortunately has a few of those flaws, although I hasten to stress that I <i>do</i> think it's a good book. Just not as good as it could have been.<br /><br />I'll have to ask my Mum if she still has her copy of <i>Gizelle</i>, because my library (which is supposed to be the best library in the country!) doesn't seem to have it. Nor does it seem to have any copies of <i>Isabella</i>. So if you say the books are both out of print, it may be hard to get hold of them. I'll do my best, though...<br /><br />I'm afraid I'm going to have to disagree with you on Anne Frank's diary. True, Frank didn't get to describe the horrors of the concentration camps, like other, much less famous authors. Granted, the diary is limited in scope (for good reason -- the author was young and locked up), but for all that, for all its naivete and little girl's stuff and misguided optimism, I think it's a great war document. Call it nostalgia, call it patriotism, but I love it. I've read it several times, and I never fail to be impressed. <br /><br />Have you read Victor Klemperer's diaries? They're supposed to be an excellent account of life in war-time Germany by a highly educated Jew who survived largely because he was married to an Aryan. I really look forward to reading them myself, although 'looking forward' is probably the wrong word in relation to something so profoundly shocking and depressing as the war.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Oh, dear. Did I come off as very defensive in my defence of Anne Frank? I'm sorry if I did. I didn't mean to criticise you in any way for your lack of emotional response to the diary. As far as I'm concerned, it's very simple -- either a book speaks to you or it doesn't. If Anne Frank's diary didn't speak to you as much as certain other war documents did, it just didn't speak to you as much as certain other war documents did. That's all there is to it. Absolutely no need to apologise for that. <i>De gustibus non est disputandum</i>, right? :-)<br /><br />For what it's worth, I loved the diary as a twelve-year-old and have loved it ever since, so I'm not sure age has anything to do with it. I guess it's just a personal thing. But by all means do give the book another try if you can spare the time at some point; who knows, it may grow on you the second time around, just like <i>Night</i> may grow on me.<br /><br />By all accounts, Victor Klemperer's diaries should make a great addition to the mountain. They got rave reviews when they were first published in Europe in the mid-nineties, so much so that I'm actually quite astonished that I haven't read them yet myself. Apparently the English translation is even better than the German original, in that the translator had the guts to excise all the dull bits and focus purely on the interesting bits, which are said to be very interesting indeed. I'll be reading them soon, I think.<br /><br />I've never read Corrie ten Boom's book, nor have I ever heard anyone mention it in Holland. I think she gets a mention in Dutch school books, but she's definitely not a household name, like Anne Frank. Is she very well known in America?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thanks, Mike! Thank you for taking an interest. :-)<br /><br />Abigail, I see what you mean about Frank and Wiesel. I'm glad we see eye to eye despite our differences. I also agree with your analysis of the elevation of personal testimonials into 'models'. That's exactly why I felt a little guilty criticising Wiesel -- it felt as if I was somehow being disrespectful to Holocaust victims, which was obviously not my intention. <br /><br />The religious overtones of the Ten Boom book might account for its not being very popular today, but back in the 1940s and 1950s, Holland was still a fairly religious place, so I'm not sure why it wasn't a hit then. I guess Holland had enough heroes in the shape of those who helped Anne Frank's family (all household names) and others who had helped Jews during the war, such as (allow me a moment of pride here) my own great-grandparents, who hid two Jewish children during the war (their stories are recounted in <i>Hidden Children</i>). I also think Holland might have been a bit too busy doing other things at the time to look for other heroes and role models. There was a country to be built up, there was a war to be fought in Indonesia, and most of all, there were fingers to be pointed and bad guys to be blamed. For many years after the war, Holland was completely obsessed with finding and shaming those who had collaborated with the Germans, which included finding the person(s) who had betrayed the Frank family. I believe that for a long time, making life hell for 'traitors' was more important than dwelling on heroes and heroines. By the time the country needed positive role models again, Anne Frank and those who had helped her family had become icons, and there wasn't much room for other icons. Even Etty Hillesum (whom I see you've read, as well) remained in Anne Frank's shadow, despite the fact that many people prefer her letters and diaries to Frank's. I guess there was only room for one Dutch war-time icon in our hearts. The fact that Hillesum's diaries weren't published until the 1980s didn't help.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Don't feel bad about not being overly fond of Wiesel, Abigail. Just because the man survived the war and wrote a bunch of books about it doesn't make him a saint. As for his attitude to the Romani, I guess he still has a fair bit of the Eastern European in him. The Romani have always been discriminated in the Balkans; to this day it appears to be entirely acceptable there to consider them third-rate citizens. My Romanian friends (most of whom are reasonably intelligent, well-educated people) are always making jokes about the Romani, and they're not always kind jokes. I guess it's hard to lose that kind of attitude if it has been instilled in you from childhood.<br /><br />Incidentally, I just found out that Wiesel's two eldest sisters actually survived the war, which would explain why they don't get a mention in <i>Night</i> along with his parents and younger sister. Still, it would have been nice if he had actually said so in the book, wouldn't it? But I guess that would have made the book less dramatic...<br /><br />I haven't read Wiesenthal, but I just added <i>The Sunflower</i> to the big pile. Thanks for the recommendation!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Your Aboriginal story sounds familiar, Abigail. My otherwise loving and caring boyfriend is Australian. He frequently says horrible things about Aborigines, and can't really understand why I should cringe at his comments. I have to say I'm beginning to see where he's coming from, though. The great majority of the Aboriginal people I saw in Australia conformed to the stereotype: they were either beggars or sat around doing nothing, often looking quite out of it. Also, my boyfriend is a policeman, in which capacity he frequently gets to deal with Aboriginal criminals. The most heinous murder he has dealt with this year (we're talking brains spilled all over the floor here) was committed by two glue-sniffing Aborigines, and he has many stories like that. He says his colleagues dread being posted to Aboriginal communities as the level of (frequently alcohol-fuelled) crime is really high there. And yes, he recognises it's a vicious cycle (society won't give Aboriginal people a chance because of their bad reputation, which in turn causes Aborigines to turn to alcohol, which in turn reinforces all the stereotypes), and yes, he recognises society is partly to blame for the terrible position in which Aboriginal people find themselves today, but still, he has no sympathy whatsoever for them. None. It's a bit scary, really. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hi to Abigail and Martine! This discussion was an absolute pleasure to read. I myself stay away from Holocaust material, it being too close to home. I'm Jewish, and was raised with the specter of it, of having family members tatooed and killed in Poland. Also, I might add, at far too young an age, I was shown that devastating film, Night in Fog. I developed insomnia at an early age, panicking over where I could run and hide if it happened again. I decided on Antarctica as the only safe place.<br /><br />So while I haven't read material for a long time, I do love to see what other intelligent people discuss. I believe Eli Wiesel's Night is such a pinnacle is because it was the first frank look at the Holocaust to be published, indeed he was the first to publicly speak about it. Most Holocaust survivors never did, even to their close family. So it was in large part due to Wiesel that the public was made aware of it.<br /><br />So I forgive him his exclusions, anyone coming out of there has been irrevocably harmed psychologically. <br /><br />One day I bet the Romanis will be romanticized as some of the last free people. Hopefully before they die out. <br /><br />As for the Aborigines, Martine what you had to say was fascinating. About 30 years ago I met a seemingly very nice S. African woman who spoke of the blacks in such a way I almost gagged in front of her. Her words were "it's for their own good, they like it that way." Etc. But the blacks had champions, such as Mandela, and of course the civil rights movement in America. Unfortunately, the Romanis and Aborigines don't. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thanks, Lori. I'm glad you approve. :-)<br /><br />You're right, <i>Night</i> is such a pinnacle because it was the first concentration camp memoir to be published. As such, it's a very important document, and I'm not denying it that status. Nor am I denying Wiesel's own importance. I may have my complaints about him, but I don't have a shadow of a doubt that he's done important things. So, honestly, I respect the man. A lot. And I'm glad his book is read by so many people, even if I think there are better ones out there.<br /><br /><i>One day I bet the Romanis will be romanticized as some of the last free people. Hopefully before they die out.</i> <br /><br />That comment brought a shiver to my spine. Brrr. I'm afraid you may be right.<br /><br />As for the Aborigines, it will be interesting to see whether my perception of them changes once I move to Australia. It's going to be an interesting time... ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with you, that while it is an amazing piece of literature for it's subject matter, the style of writing at times could have been improved upon. Where sometimes the starkness in his prose is magnificent, I found some passages a little too repetitive and wordy. Otherwise, I too would have given it 5 stars.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who feels that way, Tom. Yes, a bit more rigorous editing wouldn't have hurt the book, I feel. But I guess the editors thought they'd done quite enough editing already, what with them trimming the original from a big, fat book to a very small one. <br /><br />If I were the publisher of <i>Night</i>, I'd have changed certain passages when the new translation was published. That would have been a perfect time to have a hard, critical look at the text and revise it where necessary. I'm sorry they missed that opportunity...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I was honestly shocked to read your disparaging comments about this book. You criticize his writing and content as if he were writing a work of fiction!<br /><br />This is someone who LIVED what was written. Or rather SURVIVED, as such an existence can hardly be called living. He did not write this to become a famous author or any recognition of the sort. He simply felt that he had to add meaning to his survival by putting his experience down on paper.<br /><br />The power of this book does not lie in how well it was written or what it did or did not include, but rather, it lies in the fact that it transports us there, puts us in the shoes of those who went through this hell, and gives us a perspective we can't see from our comfy recliners and couches in the 21st century.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I had this very long comment, and then Goodreads went down. I'll sum up.<br /><br />Ummm. This is not fiction. This is a Memoir and it may not have been edited as it should because things in the book happen as he remembers.<br />Although Wiesel wrote other pieces of fiction, this is not one of them. Pictures and eye witness accounts have corroborated the events as Wiesel says. <br />I agree with Fluffy above. To classify this work as "fiction" is an insult to Mr. Wiesel and to anyone that deplores the holocaust.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with your entire review. I felt the brevity of the book actually hurt it, as it condensed the "action" so to speak into such a short time frame. Weeks and months seemed like merely days from the lack of detail and events Weisel described. Don't get me wrong - I read it in an afternoon, and the impact of reading the entire book in practically one sitting cannot be denied. But I wouldn't say it's the best piece I've read on the Holocaust experience. For a look at another teenager who loses her family and survives the Holocaust, I'd recommend All But My Life by Gerda Weissman Klein.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Agreed. Spoiler alert on the holocaust? Really, Aastha? She gave it away by mentioning that his family died in a concentration camp and that he shut all his senses and feelings down? I thought that was a given.<br />I like that this review discusses why the book isn't as good as Levi's. It's true, it isn't, and I'm glad to know why. A shame the unabridged version can't be published in the 21st century. I think restoring the original would honour Wiesel better.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I completely agree with you when you say why this book deserves four stars. I think people are giving it five stars because of the importance of the matter and not on the actual writing. Don't get me wrong but, this is a really well written book, but it isn't a five. The only reason i would be taking away a star is because like you said some parts of the book lacked details. Such as the parts of his abuse, i would've like it to be little more gruesome. I mean it was a terrible event but if the author added more detailed ideas of what happened to him the book would've been more powerful. I thought the most powerful scene was Eliezer's father's death. I think this one idea was what the whole book and ending revolved around. But what was missing was the reason and feeling for why his sisters and his mother died. I mean i understand that he couldn't have know because of the separation but his feelings were missing.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[The idea of judging this record of personal and historical tragedy as incomplete or too abbreviated may be somewhat like picking up the shards or skins or seared bone fragments from a 10,000-year-old archeological site and saying, "I wish they were bigger, I wish they gave me more." The book is an artifact left to tell us something about a time when there was a temporary but complete triumph of unabridged human brutality. Perhaps we shouldn’t measure it based on our literary expectations, but as a voice that always will speak to times just like this one. It is what it is. The brutality of terrorist and the uninformed blathering of a television actor turned demagogue don’t nearly compare with the holocaust and Hitler. But give them time. Without reminders just like this, digestible to so many because of its brevity, we could become too comfortable with them. I don’t say this in criticism of what you’ve written, which I think was done with careful consideration. I’m suggesting that we value it for what it is.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I both agree and disagree on the points you have made about this book. I agree with you that this book is a brutal dehumanization of the human spirit. It is awful to have accounts of people enslaving othe people and biting them afterwards. It is somewhat hard to view humans the same after hearing events like this happening. I however disagree that this book lacked detail and true gruesome events. This book provides vivid detail in relation to important events and encompasses a vast arrangement of horrific events that happened to Eliezer. This book in my opinion provides a perfect amount of detail to paint an image in my head of everything that happened to Eliezer and his father in this time.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I am not sure how to understand how you have read "better" books about the Holocaust. I don't see that the story needed to be better narrated. When the author wrote that he saw babies being thrown into fires...it is pretty clear to me that is enough of a description of what he witnessed. That the author needed to describe the screams, the smell of burning flesh, the cracking of skulls is not necessary to get to the point of the horror. There are no "better" books about the Holocaust...they are all horrible stories.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I have just finished reading it and I fully agree with your review. The account is effective and it directly conveys the brutality and dehumanisation of the facts. But, as a novel, there's something missing in it, there're too many important unfinished stories, too many relevant details left aside. I wonder why the first version hasn't been retaken and translated now. The world is more than ready for it.]]></body>
