  <description>With precisely 35 canvases to his credit, the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer represents one of the great enigmas of 17th-century art. The meager facts of his biography have been gleaned from a handful of legal documents. Yet Vermeer's extraordinary paintings of domestic life, with their subtle play of light and texture, have come to define the Dutch golden age. His portrait of the anonymous Girl with a Pearl Earring has exerted a particular fascination for centuries - and it is this magnetic painting that lies at the heart of Tracy Chevalier's second novel of the same title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Girl with a Pearl Earring&lt;/i&gt; centers on Vermeer's prosperous Delft household during the 1660s. When Griet, the novel's quietly perceptive heroine, is hired as a servant, turmoil follows. First, the 16-year-old narrator becomes increasingly intimate with her master. Then Vermeer employs her as his assistant--and ultimately has Griet sit for him as a model.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[The two books are very, very different but that is what is so amazing that each good book can widely vary from another. This is calm and comforting and you sink in to that life in Holland mid 1600s. VERY sensual writing. Everything happens through thoughts. I saw the movie ages ago, but it doesn't compare to this b/c you do not get into Griet's head as you do with the book. Just a few words and you feel the horror of the plague. This author writes following the rule that less is better than more - and it works perfectly. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Boof, yes it is totally wonderful. This is definitely a delightful comfort read. Which Chevalier book should I pick next? I have a strong rule that I only add one book at a time by a new author. You have read many. Want to suggest one? There was that one with fossils, but I do so like reading about artists..... This is an author I must read more of!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Oh what a tough one. The only other one she wrote about artists was <i> The Lady and the Unicorn</i> and it's the only one I haven't read.<br /><br /><i> Remarkable Creatures </i>, for me, was most similar in its gentle tone to GWaPE. You really care about the characters, and again they are real people as Griet and Vermeer were. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Needless to say it took me longer to get back online and anticipated. Our walk was nice but we still ended up getting caught in the rain, at least weeding get stuck in a severe thunderstorm. <br /><br />Hot and Florida are synonymous so we know what you're dealing with. I read about the issues you're having with Oscar, both with the heat and with the crystals that have formed. For us with the heat we limit Nougat and Cooper's daytime activity meaning we take them out more often for shorter periods of time. We leave their longest outings for the early mornings or evenings. It can take 15 to 20 min. for dog's system to overheat but they won't be aware of it until it reaches a higher level, so we monitor them very carefully.<br /><br />We had a dog, her name was Kia, who had very large bladder stones. She unfortunately needed surgery to have these stones removed, after that it was mainly maintenance. Yes there are dry foods that help control the acidity and pH levels, there are also supplements that do the same thing. Currently we have a mail cat who has chronic crystals and whom we almost lost due to a severe flareup last year. In both cases increasing the wet food ratio to dry food helped. One of the main things we've learned through research and discussion with our veterinarian is to keep the urinary tract system running smoothly. So we've also added fish oil, and recently added coconut oil, into their wet food. Another thing that is helpful to add is Apple cider vinegar, you can add that directly into their drinking water, food or the old fashion down the throat way. They do not particularly like the taste of this apple cider vinegar so you have to start off in small doses. There is a website that deals with homeopathic ways to help your pets, I'll have to look that up so you can check it out.<br /><br />Back to the books. I haven't read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/321577.Girl_in_Hyacinth_Blue" title="Girl in Hyacinth Blue by Susan Vreeland" rel="nofollow">Girl in Hyacinth Blue</a> but do have it in my TBR pile. I do agree that I like Chevalier's best works, they have stayed with me longer, but Vreeland does capture some of the creative process very well. Being an artist the scenes have to run true for me and I remember a small scene in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98049.Luncheon_of_the_Boating_Party" title="Luncheon of the Boating Party by Susan Vreeland" rel="nofollow">Luncheon of the Boating Party</a> where Renoir is choosing paints. The other thing I liked about Luncheon is that it also focused on the real people in the painting so it brought the painting to life in a way I never could of imagined. I actually had to print up a big color copy of the painting so that I could refer to it as I went along. <br /><br />I will call it a night now and hopefully see you here tomorrow. I have missed you bunches.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I hope Oscar does well with his new food change and you're high heat. Our Nougat is having some rough hip problems, it is so hard to see her struggling to get up sometimes, and she's only 3 years old right now. We I have tried diet changes, massage, and monitoring her activity level but the problem has only marginally improved. So we will have to start looking into other options.<br /><br />I hope you like the book and you may want to print up a photograph of the painting and have it in a magnifying glass by you as you are reading or listening to it. That just made me think, this is such a visual book to me that I'm curious how it will come across in an audio version. Have you ever read the other book on Artemesia by Lapierre (sp)?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Chrissie, I finished this one recently and I liked it quite a lot. As you said, the writing was simple and calm, yet there was a great passion and intimacy permeated in this story. It was very intense. I have a soft spot for artists and their models. This idea has always felt very romantic to me. And not necessarily only when the artist has a love relationship with his model. Even if he doesn't know her and won't ever meet her again, it still feels like a very sensual and exciting experience and I think the author has done a marvelous job at recreating these emotions. And I just <i>need</i> to point out that this is my favourite review of yours. Very well done. :) Oh, and I was so touched when in the end I found out how he has wanted the painting back and has left her the earrings.]]></body>
