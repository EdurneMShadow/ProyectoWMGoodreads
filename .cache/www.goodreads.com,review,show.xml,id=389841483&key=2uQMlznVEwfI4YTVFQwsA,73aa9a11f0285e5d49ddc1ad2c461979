It made me laugh and cry. It's not sad...it's <i>more</i> than that. I'm at a loss for words to describe that book so I would quote a review I loved on the Book thief-<br /><br /><i>"If you love to read and if you love to care about the characters you read about and if you love to eat words like they're ice cream and if you love to have your heart broken and mended on the same page, this book is for you.</i>]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Many readers compare that book to TFioS on the terms of "books that made you cry the most" but in my opinion, the latter is very bland in front of the former.<br /><br />The book thief teaches you so much, it touches your heart and makes you fall in love with the characters and the words in the book...in comparison, TFioS is absolutely craptastic.<br /><br />I'm surprised that Book thief has an average rating of 4.36 stars on GR whereas TFioS has 4.50!<br />That's why I never trust GR average ratings.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I'm sorry to hear you didn't enjoy it! The only thing I have to comment on is this- Hazel may seem a bit selfish when she isn't always grateful for her parents and such, but the thing is, she's a teenager. No teenager in the world is always happy and grateful. She's sixteen and in love, and all teenagers I know when they're in love, don't always act the way they should.<br /><br />Besides that, I respectively agree to disagree on this. Have you tried any of Green's other books? Abundance of Katherines is one of my favorites. It's much more lighthearted than this book, per say.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[How on earth can people complain about spoilers in this review?<br />I'm sorry, but any book featuring a beloved pet or terminally ill teenager is going to end in "and so they died." <br />It's a fact of life.<br />(Unless someone writes "Lucky, the freaking immortal Labrador." Or possibly Picoult's "My Sister's Keeper" where the "wrong" sister died.)<br />Let's be honest, I knew what I was getting into when I picked up an American YA novel about terminally ill teenagers "everyone" was raving about - teenage angst, teenage romance, flowery epithets, lying together on a car bonnet looking up at the sky at least once, indie music at a funeral...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Personally, this isn't my favourite book; it didn't make me cry. It didn't live up to the hype. And no, it wasn't what I was expecting. But I think Green has a brilliant mind and works beautifully to create two very different characters here which are both drawn into an advanced and interesting plot. The twist actually surprised me and I felt everything within the novel, although at times seeming rehearsed, was actually very credible. <br />I do however agree that this book is hyped up. Especially in comparison to his other novels. I actually prefer Looking For Alaska. Which is a lot less commercialised, both literally and metaphorically, within the book.]]></body>

And I certainly didn't cry over it!"</i><br /><br />Yeah, hype is misleading.<br /><br /><i>Molly wrote: "Hazel may seem a bit selfish when she isn't always grateful for her parents and such, but the thing is, she's a teenager. No teenager in the world is always happy and grateful. She's sixteen and in love, and all teenagers I know when they're in love, don't always act the way they should."</i><br /><br />I have read many books in which teens are in love but don't go around acting like ungrateful brats like Hazel. Lina from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7824322.Between_Shades_of_Gray" title="Between Shades of Gray by Ruta Sepetys" rel="nofollow">Between Shades of Gray</a> lives during one of the horrifying times of history, she is a teen who falls in love while she is deported to Siberia under ghastly conditions, she had given up her own freedom for her cousin yet she's never selfish and ungrateful. Another good example would be Liela from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128029.A_Thousand_Splendid_Suns" title="A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini" rel="nofollow">A Thousand Splendid Suns</a>, she lives with her parents in Kabul during wartime, her mother is emotionally and mentally broken, her father is sacked, there is no guarantee that she or her parents will live the next day, she's in love yet she's not ungrateful and whiny. And there are more...<br /><br />Besides, I'm not interested in reading anything written by Green, not after reading the following article-<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://dearauthor.com/news/friday-news-john-green-chastises-readers-for-not-being-generous-nytimes-uses-hyphens-inconsistently-apple-ibooks-for-mac-is-a-mess/" rel="nofollow">http://dearauthor.com/news/friday-new...</a>]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I absolutely love you and this review. You literally wrote everything that was going through my head whilst reading the book. My review, I have to admit, is nowhere near as coherent as yours, just because I am so unbelievably angry with John Green for writing this book and portraying the characters as he did.<br /><br />So I'm glad that there seems to be a small group of us that actually disliked the book, rather than fangirling over the 'beautiful love story'.<br /><br />I'm sorry, WHAT BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY? I do not see a romance, but a high school crush gone too far. That's all.<br /><br />And to be honest, Augustus' nickname kind of reminded me of the fat mouse from Cinderella, so that's all I could think of whenever someone called him 'Gus'.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I totally understand your valid points/opinion and concur with them. Yet the only thing that annoyed me was your comment on how cancer people can't be "magically wise" and lack in insight and meaning of life. But excuse me, have you ever met or encountered a cancer patient or people, for that matter? Yes some cancer patient don't gain insight in life which is pity for them. Again,there are some who do just like everyday people. It varies for everyone. Just because they have cancer doesn't limit their ability of philosophical thoughts. Jeez.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Dominique wrote: "I totally understand your valid points/opinion and concur with them. Yet the only thing that annoyed me was your comment on how cancer people can't be "magically wise" and lack in insight and meani..."</i><br /><br />Firstly, if anything annoyed you in my review then why did you read it in the first place? Haven't I mentioned it clearly at the beginning to stay away from this because it can infuriate you?<br /><br />I haven't met any cancer patient but I've seen lots of sick children. Sometimes they do have extraordinary talents which are genuine. Hazel and Augustus speak like wise old men which sounds so fake and utterly ridiculous. A genuinely sick kid doesn't have the luxury to be so wise. They get depressed and sad, they worry if they'll live the next minute or not, they don't go around being pretentious. They don't go around trying to impress people like Hazel and Augustus do.<br />You said that my comment annoyed you but do you know that this book has annoyed so many sick readers out there? Yes, I've read reviews and comments written by genuinely sick people saying how Tfios made them want to burn the book in disgust. They found the jokes cracked on death by the characters to be utterly sick not to mention that they have even put up similar point in question in their own review. <br /><br />I hated this book and I've given my reasons clearly. Come hell or high water, I'm not going to change my opinions over it and I won't stop from expressing my dislike for it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I haven't read this. Now I'm not sure if I want to. But I think I will read this, or I should read this to see for myself how "ridiculous" or "magical" this book is.<br />This is way overhyped though. And I don't really read overhyped books because they tend to disappoint me most of the time. <br />And the fans!! Ugh!! I hate fandoms sometimes. They could be so annoying, insisting their love for the book. Like I get okay you LOVE the book, but I hate it so go away.<br /><br />Nice review/rant by the way! Most of my goodreads friends and twitter friends don't like this book too.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Everyone has read a book that is hyped, and would like to beat said novel around fans heads :D Mine's Fifty Shades (of shit )and *cough* Twishite *cough* (I hate them with a vengence, is it obvious?).<br /><br />BUT, alas, I did like this book. Maybe even loved. Although, I have read a lot, a lot, a lot worse (even than Fifty Shades!) And I haven't been raving like a fan girl.<br /><br />Thank you, for your honest opinion :D]]></body>

You certainly are entitled to your opinion. I just meant given time you will likely (or maybe not) come across a book you dislike more. I am 66 and have come across numerous books that I hated. Sometimes going against the popular opinion as well. I hated Outlander (ducking quickly).]]></body>
