  <description>Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and inspiring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids. Along the way he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles along the way. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.</description>

This reminded me of one of my favorite Vonnegut quotes, from "Mother Night": <br /><br />"Say what you will about the sweet miracle of unquestioning faith, I consider a capacity for it terrifying and absolutely vile." <br /><br />The narrator has lived in Germany through the whole Nazi period, and had ample opportunity to observe people who believed strongly, when doubt would have been a more appropriate response.]]></body>

It was discovered by science. Religious folks who were following their hearts (religious faith) were the ones who fought against the change. Scientific discovery, the sort which realized that the earth was not at the center of the galaxy, might be seen as the opposite of following one's heart. It is about looking outside oneself at what the universe reveals.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[@Nicolo <br /><br />I think following your heart can make people sensitive if they that is their natural inclination but unfortunately many people's instincts or 'heart' does not tell them to be more sensitive . So as a rule of thumb, I think telling people to follow their heart is dangerous. It implies that whatever our instincts desire is good, but some people's instincts are awful.<br /><br />As for the quote, I'm curious why you would choose to interpret it that way? The statement is very clear and means precisely what it says: if you want something, the universe will work to bring about that particular result. While I can agree that bad circumstance can help mould someone into a better person, I cannot see how one could interpret the quote to being saying that.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[@Urmilla: Interesting observation, I suspect you are probably correct. Although in one sense Ayn Rand and Paulo Cohelo make a very similar case, that if we want something bad enough it somehow means it is good and we can and should do anything we want to get it. Seems like the main difference is Cohelo brings in a supernatural element to help us out while Ayn Rand does not.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Christopher, I think it's good that you found out that you didn't belong there. Not blaming, just commenting politely: How can you be sure that your heart led to mormons specificly, and not to spirituality in broader sense? I assume that now you're angry and disappointed to all theism, and have chosen to walk the atheism-scientism-reductionism -path. So, I'm asking because it's been years since I left the atheism camp - how do you do it? How can you close your heart? This is no joke. What mental process do you go through to actually lose faithin your own heart so completely? Practically, how do you do it? Thanks, Timo]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hello Timo, I'm not positive I grasp your question but I will try and answer.<br />You are correct that since leaving Mormonism I have become atheist/scientific/materialist etc. That being said I LOVE spirituality. I read world scriptures, pray, meditate and I frequently feel what I once called 'the spirit'. I guess the what has changed is I now interpret those experiences differently. Having gone through a few years in my life where I experimented with a variety of drugs I discovered that just a few chemical being increased in the brain can cause the exact same feeling as I felt when I felt 'the spirit'. Now, perhaps it is still God. Surely God would, after all, work through natural means. It could be 'the spirit' causes certain chemicals to release in my body. But ... while possible, I find it extremely unlikely. I would like to believe in God or the Divine. If I ever encounter an argument that is even halfway decent convincing me of the existence of a (good) God or afterlife, I would happily embrace it, in fact I CRAVE for there to be such an argument, but as much as I've searched I haven't found it yet. Although I do find some level of hope in the ideas of God being simply a highly evolved alien, or our own descendants in a million years who have harnessed the full powers of the Universe and with it, resurrection and the ability to create live and heaven.<br /><i>Timo wrote: "Christopher, I think it's good that you found out that you didn't belong there.

  <body><![CDATA[I haven't read the book yet, but read your review and others' comments with interest. <br />Two comments from my perspective: <br />1. Others who like the book have described a different theme of the book than you did. I will quote another reviewer here for their interpretation of the theme. "<br />"...A simple allegorical type of fiction that has the theme “Don’t go wandering around the world for your treasure. Look in your own backyard.” Or “Don’t worry about the past or the future, improve today and the future will improve and the past will be less important.” ..."<br />2. I think a book or song or work of art is good if it moves and inspires people to think and question and expand their viewpoint. The fact that this book has sparked so much passion and discussion tells me it is good. I don't think I need to agree with or even like the message of a book to think it's good if the book has inspired me to think and expand my perspective.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[@Christopher Allman<br /><br />I too think you have missed the point of the book. The point is (I believe) not as you say "when you want something the universe consipres to get it for you" That, I think, is a philosphy called "The Promise" - something different and more worthy of your disapprobation.<br /><br />For me the message is "When you are following the path that is (insert your own word for predestined here) for you then you are working WITH the universe rather than against it and life flows well for you and you succeed.<br /><br />If you are going "against the flow" then the universe drops hints and makes statements to that effect and life becomes more of a chore.<br /><br />No one can tell us our path - for each it is different and innate. That's why the stones given by the King could not be used to answer questions like "What should I do" and "Where should I be" - simply yes or no.<br /><br />The mysticism of the desert crossing is an allegory for finding the path, understanding the language the universe uses for guidance and commitment to go with the flow.<br /><br />The boy in the beginning never "wanted" a pot of gold that way - of did I miss it?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I think that perhaps you are missing the point Christopher. I initially had a similar reaction to the line on pg. 23 "And when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it." I considered this to be a big headed, selfish conclusion to a problem: if I want it enough it will magically come to me because it is meant to be. However, upon completing the book, further consideration and a trip back to page 23 and page 16, I feel that I have a better understanding of Coelho's intentions.<br /><br />The line before the bit about "the universe conspires" is this: "The Soul of the World is nourished by people's happiness. Also by people's unhappiness, envy and jealousy. To realize one's Personal Legend is a person's only real obligation. All things are one." this, to me, strikes a far stronger chord than the "universe conspires" statement.<br /><br />The very soul of everything is comprised of the negatives and positives involved in seeking, working towards and sometimes obtaining the "personal legend." The Shepherd boy is not the only lesson in the tale. The Crystal Shop Owner and even the Englishman also nourished the "Soul of the World" despite the very different journey or lack thereof that they had from the shepherd. Coelho writes that "To realize one's Personal Legend is a person's only real obligation." The rest is what we choose to do with it and will nourish the soul no matter the outcome.<br /><br />As for the later theme of following the heart, I believe that this advice is instructed for 2 reasons: 1. It is the "heart" in an emotional sense that gives us the eagerness, the desire and the drive to DO. The Shepherd followed his heart when he chose tone a shepherd, when he chose to leave his flock, when he chose to work for the crystal shop, etc. The Crystal Shop owner failed to follow his heart to Mecca. The Englishman followed his heart on the journey to the Oasis, however his head interfered and kept him so focused on the logic and the books related to being an Alchemist and OBTAINING his goal, that he overlooked the importance of the journey. And 2. I think that it is an instruction for improving the heart and ensuring motives are pure in regards to the Personal Legend. Just as the Alchemist purifies lead and the other metals to ultimately reach the purity of gold, we are instructed to learn, grow and purify our hearts so that we are not led astray or following blindly. The Shepherd himself relates later in the story that the heart is "Treasonous".<br /><br />Lastly I believe the statement on pg. 16 wraps it up nicely: "It's the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them."]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Your heart told you to be Mormon ("the heart is treasonous"). But I am certain your heart also played a role in your exit from Mormonism. Physiologically that is how it works. We be come uncomfortable in a situation and recognize that it is not right for us by the triggers of the emotional brain. Which in turn works with our logical brain to create a plan. I saw on your profile that you're a public radio listener. There is this amazing RadioLab podcast, I think it's called "choices", it's available free on Stitcher. I highly recommend it. So either way, your experience with Mormonism involved your head and your heart and nurtured you and, in turn, the "Soul of the World".]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Many people misunderstand this book and claim that it's message is to follow your dreams by, as you said, "wanting it as hard as you can". What I got out of this book is that the way to making peace with yourself in the world is to have a dream or a goal and take action towards it. The engine that keeps the story moving is Santiago overcoming his doubts criticisms and obstacles to continue taking action toward his goal.<br /><br />That being said I don't think this is a godly book which will change the readers life forever, although I'm sure it has probably had that effect on some people who were ready for it when reading.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[You should consider the notion that you have, perhaps, missed the point of this book. This book does quite the opposite of telling us all to deliberately "make ourselves ignorant". It shows the reader how to integrate with the world around them, to recognize that they are a part of it, not just a stranger in a hostile place. Don't let a bad experience with spirituality leave you cynical. You seem like a good fellow, slightly disillusioned by personal events but aren't we all?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Goethe said, "At the moment of commitment the entire Universe conspires to assist you." <br /><br />The operative phrase is "at the moment of commitment", in my opinion. <br /><br />Desires arrive in droves, daily. Only a fool follows every one of them. Selection involves discrimination and it precedes commitment. <br /><br />Once a person makes a commitment, their mind begins to sort events, ideas, really everything around them, and uses what is in alignment with their desire. If the desire turns out to be a blind alley, the person discards it and moves on, learning that lesson and taking another route by selecting another desire, examining it critically as well, before committing to it. <br /><br />We all use this process. The assistance of unseen forces is an imponderable but if many have experienced "coincidences" that have aided them in their quest.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Chris, I had the same reaction to the book. It struck me that the message was that as long as you stayed true to your heart and heeded its message (seeking out your personal legend) the universe would turn out in the best way possible for you.<br />I found this mindset quite disturbing. It suggests that when something terrible happens to a person, it is because the universe is just trying to nudge them in a different direction. I’m sure all the people who are victims of war, among other horrors, feel a lot better about themselves now.<br />I guess what it comes down to is that the book seems to endorse a way of thinking that just doesn’t reflect the world we live in. There is no cosmic safety net that will make sure things turn out OK for you in the end. There isn’t even a surefire way to determine what your “heart” (which is actually some part of your brain since the heart is just a muscle that pumps blood) of personal legend is, so while you might think you are following your heart you are actually screwing up and all the bad things that come out of your decisions are really the universe trying to correct you.<br />All in all a very wishy washy, unhelpful (if not dangerous) belief tucked away in a very plain story.]]></body>
