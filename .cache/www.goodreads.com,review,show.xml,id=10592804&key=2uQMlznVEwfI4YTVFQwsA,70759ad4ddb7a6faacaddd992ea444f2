  <description>&lt;i&gt;Night&lt;/i&gt; is Elie Wiesel's masterpiece, a candid, horrific, and deeply poignant autobiographical account of his survival as a teenager in the Nazi death camps. This new translation by Marion Wiesel, Elie's wife and frequent translator, presents this seminal memoir in the language and spirit truest to the author's original intent. And in a substantive new preface, Elie reflects on the enduring importance of Night and his lifelong, passionate dedication to ensuring that the world never forgets man's capacity for inhumanity to man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Night&lt;/i&gt; offers much more than a litany of the daily terrors, everyday perversions, and rampant sadism at Auschwitz and Buchenwald; it also eloquently addresses many of the philosophical as well as personal questions implicit in any serious consideration of what the Holocaust was, what it meant, and what its legacy is and will be.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[It is so wonderful to learn that there are still educators who teach the Holocaust and really try to have their students grasp the tragedy. Learning about the Holocaust in middle school and after reading the Diary of Anne Frank around age 13, I read every Holocaust memoir I could find. Now, entering graduate school, I aim to one day work for USHMM so that the Holocaust and present-day genocide are never swept under the rug. <br /><br />My school found that in learning about the history of WWII in history class in tandem with reading personal accounts in literature classes, students were able to immerse themselves in the reality of the world's situation during the time. <br /><br />Bravo to you!]]></body>

I have taught other genocides so my students know that killing and hatred live on and on and perhaps one will be a light in this often dark world. I am going to have to find another way to teach the Holocaust next year as we are locked into a curriculum and they have moved Night to another lower grade. I will find another novel so that we can again approach this very real need to never raise the rug.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[You remember me so much of my language arts teacher. Parents asked why are you teaching kids the holocaust. Can you believe people don't think the holocaust happen. They think its a big lie. It's so wonderful that you teach the holocaust, most teacher won't. I have alway been drawn to it even when I was younger. Just how it was so unbelievable and yet true. I'm only in 8th grade and I know more about the holocaust then most people. That's hard to believe. If you don't realize the past it will be your future. I hope people read this and tell others about this.]]></body>

There have been many genocides as horrible, but we, as people often want to ignore the unpleasant or the disagreeable. I think Rwanda, Cambodia, Russia all share a place in the sad history of hate towards a certain people. It gives me joy to think that someone in the 8th grade has the heart and wisdom to care - keep reading and growing. When you are in high school, you should read Maus by Art Spiegelman, but it has some language. It is a graphic novel and it is a hard read on the emotional level. Corrie Ten Boom also writes of the holocaust and she is quite readable. Of course, there is lovely Anne Frank and her gentle spirit. I think, I hope this title is right, there is a book entitled, And I Never Saw Another Butterfly about Terezin prison camp. Cheers!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I am thrilled to hear of a teacher who finds it absolutely necessary to make her students read a book like "Night". I remember reading Anne Frank in school when I was younger, and certainly my history teachers spoke to us about the Holocaust, but it was glossed over. Nobody devoted a long lesson to it, nobody made us read anything other than Anne Frank's diary. It is so incredibly important that kids get a long lesson on this horrible piece of history, both in Language Arts and Social Studies.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I think every teacher in every country should make their students read "Night". <br /><br />I was born in 1939, in Germany. My non-Nazi family lived surrounded by Nazis and murderous SS criminals. <br /><br />I started school in 1945. There was not a word about the Third Reich or the Holocaust, but the teachers, Catholic nuns, kept telling us that the Jews had murdered Jesus.<br /><br />I later attended Gymnasium (high school and college combined). There wasn't a word about the Third Reich and the Holocaust either. We read Schiller and Goethe and Gottfried Keller and ancient stuff like Pole Popenspaeler in Platt or The Nibelungs in Middle High German, but not a word about the Third Reich. I think our German teacher mentioned The Diary of Anne Frank (and I read it), but I am rather sure this was not an official class read. -- In history class, we started 3 times with the old Greeks and stopped around 1900. Our teachers avoided Hitler and the Third Reich (and of course, the Holocaust) like the plague. -- I never saw any related books displayed in bookstores.<br /><br />We had heard about the mass murders of Jews from the radio, soon after the war had ended. Our family and friends were shocked. But these were only figures. We saw a newspaper clip of the liberation of some camp in the newsreel. This again was shocking. It showed skeletons with skin, some dead, some alive. But it didn't tell about their lives.<br /><br />I think it was in the 1990s when I saw the TV series Holocaust and first got an impression what the Holocaust had been like. Yet, the worst atrocities were not, could not be shown on TV.<br /><br />It was only when I joined Goodreads (in April 2013) and learned how to order books from Amazon, that I came across "Night" (and other Holocaust memoirs) and became fully aware of the horror of the Holocaust.<br /><br />I heard that the Holocaust now has to be taught in German schools. I also heard that many, if not most, young Germans are sick to hear about it -- not sick because this horrible crime makes them sick, but sick to be confronted with it. As long as I have lived in Germany (on and off roughly 50 of my 74 years), I found Hitler, the Third Reich, and the Holocaust swept under the carpet, a conversation tabu. If Jews were mentioned at all, it was that someone made a sneering remark about Germany having to pay reparations to Israel. And when I, then, reminded of the Holocaust, there would be another sneering remark, and the person would take off or hastily change the subject. <br /><br />It is clear that the diehard Nazis and their decedents don't wish to hear about the Third Reich and Holocaust. What has always made me mad (from age 5 1/2) is that the non-Nazis let them get away with it. Most of them, including my own non-Nazi mother, stated that they no longer wanted to hear about "the bad time", as they called it. <br /><br />I think this is outright wrong. If one doesn't face history, it might repeat itself.<br /><br />The immense success of the book "Er ist wieder da" (English title "Look Who's Back" = Hitler) has me worried. This supposed-to-be funny book depicts Hitler as a somewhat likable curmudgeon. Please read my 1-star review of this book and, if you can spare the time, the following comment thread. Here is the link:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/743861870" rel="nofollow">https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...</a><br /><br />Instead of reading "Night", the stupid German masses (and now also the stupid masses of other countries, including the U.S.) obviously prefer to read a book that trivializes Hitler.<br /><br />About 10 days ago, I found an Editorial Review of this book on Amazon.de; it stated that reading this book "you don't laugh ABOUT Hitler, you love WITH Hitler". When I went back to the site, a few days later, to copy this Editorial Review, it was gone. <br /><br />Gone was, unfortunately, also my 1-star review of the book on Amazon.com. They probably deleted it so that it would not impede the sale of the English version of the book, which came out in March 2014.]]></body>
