  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?</description>

This was such an unpleasant read that I started taking notes of all the ridiculous parts. It also didn't help matters that I figured out the...]]>

  <body><![CDATA[Thanks. It's validating to read other scathing reviews from others who didn't fell into the hype. This is one of those books that a year from now I will still be able to rant about. Do share the things you loathed too! <br /><br />I even thought about including a list of things I did instead of reading Gone Girl. Stuff like scrubbing toilets, cleaning out the fridge, re-caulking bathtubs. Chores that I normally despise yet found them more enjoyable than reading this book.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Love love love all you fellow Gone GIrl haters! The Giving Tree is one of those books that always puts me in a happy place and I felt emotionally usurped when this wannabe hipster turned it into a verb. Another beef with the book - Flynn forgot to give Mike Judge credit for her masturbatory euphemisms paragraph. She must have watched the Beavis and Butthead episode "They're Coming to Take Me Away".]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I too have just joined the 'Gone Girl Loathers'. A small but growing band of sane readers, grounded enough to see this 'Emperors New Clothes' style dross for what it really is. The use of the name "Go" irritated the crap out of me, like you wouldn't believe. This book is beyond smug, and I imagine Flynn must be insufferably smug herself right now. We have to spread the truth people. We have to stop there ever being a Gone Again Girl, or a Gone Boy.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Oh man, your review is so cathartic. Nearly all of my GR friends love this stupid book. I really enjoy that you called 'Gone Girl' smug; it IS smug. The little "aren't I clever?" winks to the reader started to enrage me by page 40 or so. I made it 1/3 of the way through and then skimmed to see if it got any better. Nope, it managed to get worse. The plot was meh, the writing was just appalling.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This thread is old but my rage is new as I just finished this blasted book. A more exasperating pile of drivel there never was, with "plot twists" visible from miles before and a tedious plodding self-satisfied narration inching laboriously to its navel-gazing end. The characters are so plastic and the whole damned thing so blazingly awful, I have to believe I'm missing something. There is some subtle meta meta commentary going on that I'm missing for my rage. If not, the book is criminal for needlessly slaughtering untold trees.<br /><br />And I'm relieved to be in your company. ;)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[The negative reviews of this book are so much fun to read through. <br /><br />Fear not, Naomi. The comments may be from last year, but my rage is still fresh as a daisy. The only way the plot "twists" could be any more obvious is if they were shouted through a megaphone or over a PA system. The fact that I'm still steamed about this book almost a year later speaks volumes of it's awfulness. <br /><br />Just think of how many more people will be gushing about the book once the movie is released. *shivers with fright* Gone Girl feels like the adult version of Twilight with its rabid fans who would push us loathers in front of a train just because we think the book sucks a big one. <br /><br />Your mention of plastic characters makes me picture Nick and Amy as Barbie dolls, except they're the ones who didn't pass the quality control checks.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I am also afraid, very afraid, that when the movie comes out we'll have a whole new set of Gone Girl fans (and this time it will be the ones that don't read!). The nightmares are starting already. I thought it was bad working in a public library where a new patron discovers this book each week and just has to share with me how great it was. I shudder in horror, but smile politely as I inform them that I didn't care for it at all.]]></body>

God help us all come October when this hits theaters. <br /><br />Beth, I can only imagine what some of those books are! That's got to take some self control to not give them the look of death when they kvell over a rotten book. <br /><br />Every time I see this book on store shelves, I either flip it backwards or hide it behind different titles in the fleeting hopes that it will prevent one person from reading it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Finished the book 5 minutes ago and immediately went in search of reviews that would validate my frustration. I am so glad that I found this thread if only to enjoy the relief that there are other people who also found the nickname "Go" grating against their nerves.<br /><br />It may seem like a good idea to compose a story with "surprises on every page" but this only gives the reader plot twist whiplash for a few chapters. After that it just becomes predictable. As I read this door-jam I found myself thinking, "this means absolutely nothing" which then caused me to think of the next plot twist that I guessed correctly about 85 percent of the time. <br /><br />It held my interest....... Full of it's own crap<br />But I can only blame myself for continuing to read this waste of trees and ink.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I have to admit that I read this book mainly because the author shares my name (a rare thing to find).... It took me over a month to get through just the first half of the book. A month...for someone who read all three "Divergent" books in 5 days. I rather liked the twist to the middle but the ending just fell flat. I hated every character, I agree that there was way too much profanity used for such an intelligent woman to use in her writing, and I completely agree with other readers who found the entire paragraph of jack-off euphemisms entirely too much....here's to hoping I enjoy her other two books much more.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I don't understand how anyone with half a brain could like this book and some of my friends really enjoyed it and I KNOW they're smart people. What gives? My whole book club HATED this book. With a passion. The female protagonist was such a caricature of every negative cliche about women, that the women in my book club were OFFENDED that another woman could write such a pathetic excuse for a female. I'm still not sure how or why I finished it, I guess I kept hoping it would get better somehow? I tried reading one of her other books just to see if it was the particular story or the author herself. It's the author. Anyone who thought this book sucked is alright by me.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This is the worst book I have ever read!. I should never have kept reading. I did because, first, I was mad I spent money on it, and, second, I had heard it had a big surprise ending. Really??? That ending??? Hated it from the beginning and shame on me for finishing it. I will put more value on my time now, since I have to make up for time lost on this piece of crap!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I stayed up late last night to finish this book and now I'm enraged that I wasted my time on such a piece of crap! The level of psychosis is ridiculous. I feel gross having read it. I wish I could wash it out of my brain. <br /><br />It was on a list of "Books to Read Before the Movie Comes Out". And I have a rule for myself to always read the book before seeing the movie. I do think that a good movie could be made out of this movie if you changed the ending and tweaked a few characters to soften their personalities. Hopefully this happens. <br /><br />I also think it's funny that Ben Affleck is Nick. He does that "douchey smile" thing. <br /><br />But I will forever hate this book.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[And now not even grocery shopping is safe. As I'm in the checkout lane at the grocery store I see paperback copies next to the celebrity smut magazines. So naturally I made a comment and the cashier asked what caught my eye so I said only one of the worst books ever written. She then looks around and says oh my god I hated it too. Who knew I'd find another hater at the grocery checkout. <br /><br />As for the movie, I think Kanye West would be a better choice as Nick. At least he would more than supply enough doucheyness. What surprises me is that Shailene Woodley isn't Amy since she's in freaking everything. I cringe when I think of her as Hazel from The Fault In Our Stars...epic casting fail.]]></body>

And then some!<br />However, what angers me the most is that I finished reading the f*****g piece of crap!!!! For some f*****d up reason I had to go to the end.<br />What's wrong with me!! I just don't understand why I put myself through that - the story was pathetic and the writing was atrocious - no talent!!!! I cannot believe well-read individuals loved this book!!!<br />I read this ages ago and it still evokes a horrible rage in me!!!<br />Go away Gone Girl!!!!!!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I fell prey to the hype and picked up GG because all my friends raved about it. I haven't even given it a rating yet because I feel so icky after reading it. I'm still having trouble putting my thoughts into words. I read the book in two days thinking it would get better and I'd be surprised at all the "plot twists". Twists I predicted way in advance. This book was not what I expected. It made me snarl. Not a single like able character and really...THAT ending?!? Lame. Will have to write a full review when I can pull this altogether.]]></body>

Every time I hear someone saying they loved this book I nearly punch them in the face. Two thumbs down for sure!]]></body>
