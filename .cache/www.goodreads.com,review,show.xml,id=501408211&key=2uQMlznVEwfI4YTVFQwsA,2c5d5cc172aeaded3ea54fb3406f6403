  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?</description>

  <body><![CDATA[No this was her first book I read and probably her last, it wasn't just the bad ending, it was the logical flaws too. She's too clever for me. Her writing is top notch. She clearly was an editor in a former life. But the story, was weak. It's not one of those stories where you don't see it coming. Its one of those stories that blindsides you because you're appalled that the author 'went there'. Which would have worked, if it weren't for the flaws... For example, the red necks stealing her money part, that would have been a lot better if she had been a sociopath enough to have gotten one over on them too. Like part of her plan was ensnare them too, not to use them as makeshift patsies. That would have wowed me a bit. The way it stands now, she's still a brat who really hasn't made the case as to why she did any of it. Is it all really a game of one-upmanship?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I actually disagree with you about the price of milk thing. It's not that she never bought milk before, but that she never paid attention to the price of milk, having never needed to. <br /><br />I think this was one of the stronger sections of the book, as it showed someone trying to hide in a different area of society with no understanding of how it works. This is backed up by her spending $500 on stuff to make her cabin nicer - as if this is a reasonable amount to spend on sheets and towels, and as if anyone visiting the cabin wouldn't notice it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I understand your point exactly, I just think you missed mine a bit. I know many people who behave and live just the way you've described. I think I might even have been in her same position had I done what she had. But...the real issue is how cavalierly she planned this part of her deception in comparison to the other. Truth be told, I have the same issue with Sherlock Holmes in his detecting skills. His powers of recall and perception are keener than a room full of IBM computers but Doyle on occasion will give him a childlike quality with regard to his interpersonal skills. (Again on occasion, when it suits the story. Because there are times when he can pluck out the character's next thought before the reader could come to the logical conclusion.)<br /><br />I just see this as the fantasy of a housewife who's sitting around thinking, "I'll pretend to kill myself and then he'll be screwed. Yeah! I'll really do it and then he'll be sorry..." Not the motivations of an actual sociopath. It didn't work for me as a story. Pure shock was the only thing that motivated me to turn the pages.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I felt exactly the same when I finished! I loved this book so much; the ups &amp; downs/twists &amp; turns. I was recommending it to everyone at work at one point &amp; finished it in less than 3 days. But the ending? I felt like I might have been missing a whole chapter or two on my iPad version. Great review! Hit very close to home for me. I did like her writing style, despite feeling cheated at the end, and will probably give her other books a shot.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Maybe but that's not the point, for me, at least. I just feel like Flynn was taking a stab at hipsters, and she really laid it on thick with Amy. And I've met so many people like Amy and I generally dislike them too. (And being a successful writer, I bet Poor Gillian has too much exposure to them.) But I don't Amy being capable of murder. She's too self-centered and narcissistic to ever put that much time and attention to hating anyone. Sure she might fantasize about all of what she did, and delude herself into thinking that she could and would. But when it really comes down to faking your own death and murder, I just don't see it. She's never committed to anything but crepes...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[good point. I guess you could look at it that way, too. But maybe, in a way, it was a hint,a kind of guiding light by Flynn, since we all knew something was fishy about that diary, you know, before we actually found out it was a decoy...It was that whole style of writing that made me go:''OKay, you're setting up a ''smth's not right here'' vibe, I'm up for it, bring it on.'' lol!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Priest Onome of royaltempleofallsolution@gmail.com , Here is my testimony from a Heart Warming indebted Client (Sarah Luis from United states) Sir i had to write back to you though I am at work now to let you know that your spell has successfully worked, and he has returned back to me just as you said it sir. A beautiful of red roses was just brought to my place of work from the man I contacted you about on January 15th. Sir i am so happy to tell it to the whole world now that he returned back to me through your powerful spells yesterday at about 6:00pm. Everything worked out just the way you said it. No more doubt. Because Lord Priest Onome realizes we were meant to be, and that we were compatible. This is actually hard for me to believe now. It’s really surprising!! Thank you so much Priest Onome for weaving you magical powers on me, and for reuniting me and my ex together with your utmost powers. You can contact him for help via email: royaltempleofallsolution@gmail.com]]></body>
