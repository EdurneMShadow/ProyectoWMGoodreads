  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winning will make you famous. &lt;br /&gt;Losing means certain death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, is a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by 12 poorer districts. Early in its history, a rebellion led by a 13th district against the Capitol resulted in its destruction and the creation of an annual televised event known as the Hunger Games. In punishment, and as a reminder of the power and grace of the Capitol, each district must yield one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 through a lottery system to participate in the games. The 'tributes' are chosen during the annual Reaping and are forced to fight to the death, leaving only one survivor to claim victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives. , she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature.</description>

      <![CDATA[I started this book thinking the idea was preposterous: a government choosing to squelch rebellion by forcing its citizens to give up their children as contenders in the ultimate reality show of death to the last survivor. Yeah right, and yet it reminded me a lot of the absurdity of the Nazi part...]]>

  <body><![CDATA[i really like this book and was hook from the get go. It actually reminded me of Lord of the Flies a bit too and I'm not sure why except it came to my mind while reading it. <br /><br />I was expecting it to be a bit more gruesome, but like you said I think Collins handled the deaths quite well. In fact, I thought she did an excellent job of making sense of the whole situation. So many books like this, where the odds are stacked against the heroine, out of no where they prevail for no reason at all. I loved that everything made sense and could have completely happened.<br /><br />I actually really enjoyed the character Katniss and am looking forward to seeing what she will happen in the next one...I'm so glad I don't have to wait for it to be published.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Nuts! I'm counting down. I read this the summer before Catching Fire came out. I didn't have to wait as long as you. I can't imagine.<br /><br />Collins is a good writer and I like everything about her writing (it's tight and clean and descriptive and engrossing) except the fragments, but I think that may have to do more with a growing trend than with her. She just uses them more than anyone else I know. As far as I'm concerned, she can do whatever she wants and I'll still eat up her stories.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I enjoyed your review the book, i felt the same way with many of your comments. i really like as well how it really coould have been a darker, bloodier book and so happy the author didnt do that. she had such great character development. my only critique of the book was her style of writing it drove me crazy i had to try and ignore it the whole time. I really didnt like her first point of view in the presnt tense. i dont know why but it reads really wierd. thanks for your review, glad to know other share similar thouhgts :-)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Ditto here, Annalisa, although I do like your review. I liked this book so much it's one of those for which I couldn't write an adequate review, let alone a good one. That's true of many of my favorite books. When I see others' reviews though I do get inspired. Maybe if I reread the trilogy at some point, I will try to write a worthy review.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Excellent review. I read this book more out of curiosity than anything else in the beginning. I work in the entertainment industry and my hairdresser's young daughter (age 9) wanted to attend the premiere of the movie. I was game to try to get her a pass for it. But then I started looking up reviews on the internet and learning more about the subject matter. There was a lot of controversy surrounding these books, so decided to read The Hunger Games to see what all of the fuss was about. <br /><br />Admittedly, I was hooked from the word go. I ran out to get the other two books in the series and would read them until my eyes were closing, because I couldn't put any of them down. <br /><br />I understand that many people feel that there are important and valuable lessons about life and society as a whole to be learned in the story that is told and I do agree. But had I known how intense the subject matter to be, I would not have been so agreeable to try to arrange for a 9-year-old to see the movie (while her mother was perfectly fine with her seeing it). <br /><br />After reading the full series, I believe that this is a true YA book, for young adults and not appropriate for anyone under 16.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[My daughter is 11 and I finally broke down and let her read it this year since all her friends have. Initially, I had intended 13, but even her teacher was discussing it in class. I think they understand on a simpler level--not that all the death doesn't affect them. It does. And I've secretly been happy that Catching Fire didn't start off interesting enough to captivate her because Mockingjay is hard to read. Some day I'll encourage to finish the series, but for now I'm happy to encourage her to read The Hobbit. So while the girls who think this is all about Gale vs Peeta annoy me somewhat, I'm glad the younger ones are somewhat shielded. They can revisit it at a later date and understand some of the harsher points then.]]></body>
