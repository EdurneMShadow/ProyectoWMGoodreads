  <body><![CDATA[Yeah, I was ticked at Katsa in Graceling for the same reason, the sex without any real commitment thing. Plus, in that book the sex scene came out of nowhere. Sure, I knew they were interested in eachother, but their first kiss was shortly followed by sex, the same night. I'm sorry, but I felt dirty after reading that. <br /><br />I'm sure no sex will be happening in this series. I'm glad there won't be any, as I think that sort of thing would surely muck up the real point of the story. <br /><br />Not that it matters but I think Katniss is pining for Peeta, not that she seems to know it yet (or it's just wishful thinking on my behalf). She can't stop thinking about him. So maybe, when it comes to the whole relationship front, Peeta may win. That is, if he doesn't die. <br /><br />I'm really scared for Peeta right now, not that that's any sort of spoiler, because it's not. I don't know any more about his situation then I did at the end of Catching Fire.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Even though I now think that the love triangle business is of very little importance in this particular series, IMO Peeta is Kat's better match. Gale seems to be only a guy-friend material. And I certainly don't expect any schmexing. They are kids, they have plenty of time for that and I don't think Collins will get herself in this kind of bind. It's not Twilight "saga" where everything revolved around if Bella will finally get some or not, right?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I think they need to grow up a little before they decide it's time to commit to someone forever, and/or have sex. The thing with YA literature that tends to irritate the hell out of me is the fact that these kids seem to think the person they're currently into is their forever love, their soul mate. <br /><br />Books like the Hunger Games or The Demon's Covenant contain a realistic view of what went on in my head (relationship-view wise) when I was a teenager, so I can better relate to them, the characters in the books. I didn't run around thinking I was in love with every hot boy who gave me a smoldering look and could kiss like a pro. I loved the attention, sure, but I knew it wasn't "forever love". I never fooled myself into thinking that I met my soul mate during my teen years. <br /><br />I guess it's why I remained a virgin as a teenager, I'm cynical. Besides, romance never really was my thing. Well, and I grew up in a religious home. But still, plenty of other girls who were raised in my religion had sex during their teen years. I also know a lot of people raised without religion who chose to not have sex until they were really in love, and not the dramatic, hormone-fueled version of love one feels when they're teenagers. So, while religious beliefs can play a part it what teenagers choose to do or not do, I also KNOW that teenagers will do what they want. I'm not a fool.<br /><br />When it comes to sleeping around with little to no commitment, well I don't consider that empowering. I think it's sad, and depending on the circumstances, cheap. Call me old fashioned but I feel that when you have sex you're giving the most important part of yourself to your partner. Trusting them with everything you have to give. I think both parties should be emotionally ready to have sex. <br /><br />Heroes and Heroines don't always have to end up together. Love stories are great, but don't always have to be the end result of a story. <br /><br />I love books in which the heroine figures out who she is and solves her problems on her own, without relying on the "strong, smart man" to come along and solve all her problems. <br /><br />I want my girls to grow up knowing they're just as intelligent and capable as the boys their age. That romance isn't all that it's cracked up to be, and that you have to work at all relationships in order for them to work out. <br /><br />Also it must be said, I've never believed in the concept of soul mates or the whole "meant to be" thing (like I said, romance isn't really my thing, though I do believe in love). I don't believe in destiny. I believe that some people are better suited for eachother, and whether or not they get together is up to them. And whether or not their relationship works out is up to how much work they put into it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[A great response, Penny. I agree with you wholeheartedly. It's not about staying virgins before marriage and so on, I personally don't think that sexual relationship without firm commitment are emotionally satisfying. I prefer fiction, both YA and adult, where intimacy is in fact an intimate act between people who actually want to be together long term and don't settle for a one-day-at-a-time arrangement like Katsa and Po do. I especially agree with you, Penny, in the part about trust. I (again, I am speaking only about myself here) don't think it's a good idea to sleep with someone you don't trust, and how can you trust someone who you think might leave you for someone else, like Katsa thinks about Po.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Great thoughts, Penny. I just want to add something about the kids "debate" as I've heard so many say it was some kind of cop-out. We have 2 heroines on our hands who refuse to have children - Katsa and Katniss. I am not a child-lover (I don't have any and not planning to have any at the moment), but I find that while I thought Katsa's final decision never to have children was the ultimate weakness of hers - she never got over her trust issues and fear, Katniss's decision to finally have them, in spite of her insecurities, was a triumph. This is why, in the end, I respect and admire Katniss much more than Katsa. For Katsa I feel sad, because she never overcame her issues.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[*******spoiler*******<br /><br /><br /><br />I think that Katniss' delayed decision to have children was possibly linked to her PTSD. Think of it this way, would you have children knowing that one day they would be taken away from you to participate in a fight to the death? (I am not talking about children becoming soldiers off to fight in a war, I am talking about the killing of children for entertainment purposes as in the games - the former is a different topic altogether). <br /><br />I think maybe she wanted to be sure that her world had changed for the better and it was part of her healing process or a result of healing.]]></body>

And honestly, who could blame her if she had done any of that? I certainly couldn't. I think, had I been in Katniss shoes I'd have done any combination of the above. But no, Katniss didn't go that route. She's a survivor. Not only that but she took back her life completely. Sure it took time, but who cares? She was able to heal and get over her fears. What a wonderful thing.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Great Mockingjay review Penny. I just finished it about 5 minutes ago and I'm still reeling. The epilogue pushed me over the edge too. Even through all the sadness and pain, the story was ultimately beautiful because the human spirit triumphs. <br /><br />I also agree with you about Katniss's detachment. She would have to be crazy to remain emotionally connected constantly. I love the way that Collins handled the entire story. The storyline with Gale and Peeta was handled appropriately as well(IMO).]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I love what you said about your dad. Did you know Collins' dad was an air force pilot? My grandpa was a career soldier who fought in WWII, and he would never talk about the war either. I love what you said about the sociopath thing, ha ha, perfect, I couldn't agree with you more. The whole point of the story was that you can't be a pawn and win. You can only reclaim yourself.<br /><br />I loved Katniss. She was brave, savvy, tough, passionate and a chick you did not want to mess with. But I loved her best because she was kind and vulnerable and she never wavered in her convictions. No matter what the consequences to her, she always, always did what she thought was right. And I really do think she did win in the end. She cleared Panem of the two main threats to peace - and set the stage for a world where she could break her vow and have her own kids. What more could anyone ask of her?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I like the way you see the book. I was really disappointed and depressed when I finished reading it, and posts like yours help me see it differently. I have a question though, what do you mean by the ultimate rejection that broke your heart in katniss behalf. Sorry but at this moment I can't guess what you're talking about and I'm curious!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I wholeheartedly agree with your review, new updates included. I reread the series after the first hunger games movie came out. I'd enjoyed Mockingjay when the book was released; in fact, I sped through it that same night, so I don't think I processed it completely. Afterwards, when everyone was talking about how much Katniss's whining was dragging the book down, how depressing it was, etc., I wondered if I'd just overlooked big issues because I was just so happy to read the conclusion. <br /><br />But after that reread, I am still totally behind the book. I didn't exactly ENJOY the Katniss 'whining' (and maybe I skimmed a few parts of her internal monologues) but I completely understood WHY they were there, why she felt how she felt, and felt deeply satisfied with the ending (even her having children. I want to roll my eyes so hard when people get very upset she had kids after saying she didn't want them. Yes, some people will never change their stance on that topic, even if they decided at a young age, and that's fine. But Katniss ended up not being one of those people, and that is ALSO okay. Heaven forbid a young girl experiencing PTSD grow up, reexamine her feelings and realize she wants children with the man she loves now that the world she lives in is better.).]]></body>
