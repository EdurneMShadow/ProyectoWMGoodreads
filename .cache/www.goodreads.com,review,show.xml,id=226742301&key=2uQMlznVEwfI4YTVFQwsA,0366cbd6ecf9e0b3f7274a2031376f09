  <description>&lt;i&gt;There is an alternate cover edition &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25856606-the-fault-in-our-stars" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, then all at once."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the tumor-shrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis. But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel's story is about to be completely rewritten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insightful, bold, irreverent, and raw, The Fault in Our Stars is award-winning author John Green's most ambitious and heartbreaking work yet, brilliantly exploring the funny, thrilling, and tragic business of being alive and in love.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[I read your review and I just felt I had to comment on it; I hope you don't find that presumptuous. I very much enjoyed this book, but I've never gone through the sort of experience it describes. The "hope in a hopeless situation" aspect spoke to me for other reasons. <br /><br />That being said, I am so very sorry for your loss and I can understand how reading an account of a similar situation that strays so much from your personal experience can be painful and frustrating. I have a close friend who lost a brother to cancer at a young age and I waffled back and forth as to how to discuss this book with her when she asked for my opinion. Based on what you are saying, I'm glad I told her that it would probably be a bad idea to read it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I don't want to get into an argument of any kind, so let me start by saying that I respect what you said here. So if I'm out of line at all, please assume I'm not articulating myself as well as I wish I could.<br /><br />First of all, if John Green had known someone who was lost at a young age, would you change your mind about what he has license to do? For that matter, are you aware that (while Hazel is a fictional character 100 percent) John did befriend a nerdfighter who fought lung cancer and died as a teenager (Esther Earl, may she rest in awesome). <br /><br />The idea that only people who have experienced similar hardships have "the right" to laugh when Gus jokes about taking Hazel's breath away, seems to put to many restrictions on what readers and writers can do. I think that John Green was incredibly respectful in his writing, and who is anyone to tell him he was out of line in writing this? <br /><br />But besides that, in the end, (SPOILER) the only "hope in the hopeless" Hazel gets is that it was worth all the pain just to have had the chance to know and love Gus. Personally, I think that's a tragic ending to a tragic story. But it's also the most respectful and reserved "life lesson" John could've pulled out: that life's not fair, but hopefully the good parts are worth the bad parts.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I think that is really thoughtful of you, Jessica. I am all for recommending JG books, but perhaps not this one to someone who has experienced something so similar. I'm going to stick with my Looking For Alaska pimping. <br /><br />Priya, I am already aware of your points. I've been a loyal vlogbrothers viewer since 2007.<br />However, I think your point just proved the point I was making with my review. I don't believe the life lesson of a 17 year old dying from terminal cancer is that the good parts are worth the bad parts. That, in my mind, and let me reiterate again, <i>from my personal experience</i>, negates not only the senseless tragedy of dying from such an illness - but it is a life lesson that is there simply for those who remain intact and living. With no real consideration for the person whose life has been cut short.<br /><br />I don't even think that is the point JG was making with the novel. The flavour of broccoli has no bearing on the flavour of chocolate.<br /><br />My concern that this is a sentimental and gratuitous telling of a horrific situation is proved if the majority of people believe it is worth all of Hazel and Gus's pain just to love one another.<br /><br />And respectfully, I think you articulated your self very well. Which is to say, you wanted to make various points explaining to me how my experience of this novel was wrong.<br /><br />At no point did I say I thought this was a terrible book. And at every point along the way I reiterated and explained that this stems from my experience. An experience, I must add, that will never be solely mine, and therefore this is a reaction that many may have to the novel. I just happen to be the one that has articulated it on goodreads.<br /><br />I think it is a great luxury to be able to read this novel with no prior experience of the subject matter. But I also think that will be the reason people enjoy it so much.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Okay, so the first thing I want to say is that I realize reading it back that "the good things are worth the bad" is not what I meant to say it all. It was an unfortunate attempt to summarize what Augustus says in (SPOILERS) the letter he writes at the very end. "You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers." Maybe a better concluding thought is, when everything's shitty and absolutely nothing is fair, the best we can do is to surround ourselves by people who make us feel like we "like our choices." <br /><br />But I'm going to stop there, because the fact of the matter is: no, I haven't experienced anything like what you have. It would not be nerdfightastic for me to go back and forth on this sticking up for my points (which are nothing more than opinions). I hope you don't feel like I was saying your experience of this novel was wrong! Nobody's experience of any novel can be wrong. John's always saying: it's no longer his book, it's each of ours. And we get to take from it whatever we can and want. I'm very much hoping you don't take away any negative sentiment from my comments. dftba.]]></body>

I can see that people would love this book, and in no way do I think it is wrong if people do. It's an excellently written novel.<br /><br />It's part of the glorious tapestry of nerdfightaria to have differing opinions, right? ;)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hi dear Rhi - I loved your review - it was well articulated, thoughtful, and honest. Thank you for sharing something so painful and I am deeply sorry for your loss. <br />If I may chime in.... Everyone filters books/words (as authors or readers) through experience. For example, I am married and take my vows seriously. When I read a book where someone has an affair and it is explained away or made light of or excused, it irritates me. Does this mean that everyone who is married will respond the same way? No. Does it mean that everyone who likes the book is anti-marriage? Of course not. However, when things I hold sacred are in some way sullied I am usually convicted to share my views. And that is the beauty of Goodreads. Because somewhere, someone might feel the same way and it is nice to know you aren't alone. It is also nice to not be raked over the coals for giving an opinion. Take care friends.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[He has, Pat. As a chaplain on a cancer ward, i think. And I think it shows in the writing. The more I think about it though and the more gushing reviews I see about this novel, the more uncomfortable I get. I can't articulate it fully but I think it has something to do with the idea of this story full of, and ultimately about, death being a form of YA entertainment. When the author has first hand experience at just how endless this kind of suffering feels, it's weird that his readership won't because the book obviously ends. And has to. As books have a tendency to do.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hi. Thank you for this review. I admit, the beauty of the first half of the book had me mesmerized and then I began to just hurt too much. I can only read a sentence or two every now and then. And it is exactly for the reasons you state. I haven't watched a 17 year old cease to exist, as you say. But I have watched plenty of friends who were older cease to exist. I wish it were more like how Green describes it. Wouldn't that be easier for us all. But it is not. There is no energy to be cynical or wry or hyper-intelligent at all times. Fiction is fiction. Characters are characters. The subject matter, though, is one that will touch the vast majority of us at some point in our lives and it is so darn difficult to read this story knowing that millions sit in hospitals and hospices suffering mightily. I will finish the book because Green can tell a story like no one else. But it will be in fits and starts. And bits and pieces. And it may take me months. Years. It's heavy. Is it maybe even heavier than Green ever imagined?<br /><br />My prayers are with your family and the real things that you are experiencing. Hang in there and be light.]]></body>

It is an incredibly heavy book, one that I believe could only be enjoyed and gushed over if you have had no experience with the subject matter"</i><br /><br />I just wanted to say, first, that I like and respect your review, respect your experience, and think you expressed why you feel that way really well. You articulated some of the parts of TFIOS that bothered me but I didn't put into words. I also don't want to argue, but would legitimately like to discuss a difference of opinion. <br /><br />I think it is a little unfair for you to say that only those who have not lived through this experience could like the TFIOS. My younger brother has an inoperable tumor at the base of his spine, a ticking time bomb we have been waiting living with for quite some time. Sometimes it grows fast, sometimes it lays dormant for years, and so we have no idea when it will finally kill him - all we know is that it will. He has other complications as well, and I can't tell you how many times in my life I have sat outside a hospital room wondering if this would be the time he didn't wake up. He was born with many of his problems, and I was only two when he was born, so I have never really know life without the fear of his death hanging over me.<br /><br />I found out just last night that my older brother's brain is riddled with lesions, and we are hoping like hell that it is MS and not cancer. I lost my 26 year old cousin in April, six months after they found his metastasized melanoma. I lost my 3 year old cousin after three years of leukemia. I have lost, and will lose, so many more family members and friends to cancer. I attended 12 funerals last year alone. Genetic predispositions combined with a really large family really sucks. In fact, I can't remember a time in my life when cancer wasn't a DAILY part of my life. <br /><br />There were definitely parts of the TFIOS that I didn't like, or that didn't get things quite right, but at other times I felt like it did. I liked the book for one of the reasons that you did not - I like that it invites people who have no experience to join in. I don't know how you felt, but when I was much younger, my brother's disability felt very isolating, but it was a privileged sort of isolation - "you can't understand because you haven't been there!" The disdain one feels as all those people who weren't there for the end write crap on the facebook wall that just doesn't make sense for the person anymore. The people who only saw them all cleaned up, tubes hidden under sheets, plastic encouraging smile pasted on during visiting hours. It took me a long time to understand that they WANTED to understand, they just didn't know how. When all you have to go by is the "I Hope You Dance" songs, "encouragements" or St. Jude's Heroic child commercials, it is hard to really get it. And I pushed away a lot of people who really did just want to help, and just wanted to understand, because they "didn't know" and "hadn't experienced it." <br /><br />Books can be a way to experience something outside of yourself, and I COMPLETELY agree that parts of TFIOS missed the mark, but I thought the parts that were right were worth it. I feel like people who haven't had those experiences NEED to see some of the realities. <br /><br />All that said, I am sorry for you and your brothers. I know that wrenching loss, and that fear, and I am so sorry that you all have to experience it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Michelle, thank you for this comment! I too thought there were brilliant parts to the novel. The description of a facebook wall would be one of them. I’d add her teary father, her mother who became a self-taught expert on her condition, and actually, I thought Augustus’s ex-girlfriend was possibly one of the most realistic characters in the whole novel.<br /><br />I don’t think it was a bad novel at all. I think Green is excellent at what he does. I just think it is heavy. <i>Too heavy for me.</i> And also too light at the same time. With conclusions that are too easy amidst situations that are excruciating. As I’m sure you will understand. <br /><br />I think my comment about the novel only being enjoyed by those who have never experienced it, was mostly in reference to the over-arching ideas of hope and meaning, etc. And again, that is mostly because that is how I personally reacted to it. Having read your review, I can see how others may read this as a refreshing glimpse into the life of a terminally ill teenager. I just struggle with the idea of this novel being gushed over because readers think the teenagers are so awesome! And the life message is so thoughtful. And because it broke their hearts! and made them cry! Without having to contemplate it too much in the reality of things.<br /><br />I am also very aware this is a judgement on my part ;)<br /><br />I guess I am just always concerned about balance, you know? Because just as this is a glimpse into an example of some stories, there is also a million other different experiences of this situation. I wouldn’t want the readership of this book to think this *is* the cancer experience, and these *are* the things we can learn from it. I think they are for Green, and the people he has come into contact with, but it isn’t the only experience of it. I think I am rambling now.<br /><br />I’m going to PM you in regards to the rest of this comment, if that is okay. I’m aware this is already quite long, and I have a lot to say about the isolation comments you brought out :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I would love to talk to you as well. (A thank you so much for taking my comment in the spirit is was intended!) And I totally get what you mean about balance. As I am sure you could see from the timeline, I wrote the review right after I finished, probably passing over some of the parts I didn't like in favor of being just so darned glad that everyone wasn't all "stoic" and "heroic" the whole way through. And it was before we learned about my older brother. And I must add that I absolutely have to sit on my hands to keep from typing, "HOLY CRAP YOU JUST DIDN'T GET IT!!" On the gushy reviews that think of this book as an inspirational love story.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I'm aware, Emily. As I mentioned previously in reply to somebody else who made the same comment.<br />I'm not sure I understand why 'being allowed' is placed in between bunny ears though. I think anybody can write about anything they like. Whether I think some people should write about everything is a different matter. I think I made it clear in my review that my struggle with this novel is that it is too easy. It has clean conclusions and isn't a true (<i>
  <u>in my opinion</u>
</i>) depiction of the sheer hopelessness of teenage death/terminal illness.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Sorry, I didn't see the other comment.<br />As for the "" - "being allowed" was a concept derived from your review, as opposed to one I agreed with, so I wanted to make the distinction between my view and yours. I'm sorry you didn't like the book and found it jarring, and I can see why you did. I just wanted to say that it came across in your review that John was being ignorant of teenage cancer sufferers' lives, and I wanted it to be clear that that was not so. I'm very sorry if I've misjudged you but that is the impression I gained from your review.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[The comments on this are long and I'm guessing quite heavy, so I apologize for not reading them all before commenting on your review. I really appreciate what you had to say about this book, and it does make perfect sense to me. I've also heard a similar point before, when a cancer survivor/librarian I know told me she felt that someone who hadn't suffered the anguish of cancer had no right to write about it from a first-person perspective. (I realize that isn't exactly what you're saying, but bear with me.) <br /><br />I think the place JG was coming from here were his years as a hospital chaplain for a children's ward, which I imagine would take a toll even on a spectator. I think he was trying to make sense of all the tragedy he witnessed there, that ultimately resulted in him leaving the job. I think he was trying to reconcile how we are all going to die, but most of us don’t have to be aware of it all the time. That’s how I read it anyway, and is a large part of why I appreciated the book as much as I did. <br /><br />I’d really like you to bring your take on the book up to him, if you ever get a chance – I know he reads his email, although he doesn’t often respond. It’s the kind of thing he would have thought about, or would want to think about. I’m not sure if it’s alright for me to laugh at Augustus’s jokes. I know that I still don’t know anything of what it’s like to love someone who’s dying, and I’m sorry you do - but I know that someday I will too, and hopefully this book will offer some comfort. That’s my take, anyway.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[beautifully written review...I am the mother of a pediatric cancer survivor and I totally get your question as to this story was his to write-no matter how lovely it is if you haven't experienced the sadness of watching a child or young teen lose their battle with cancer then you can't truly write about it with a full understanding; however I will take the awareness that it shares with all that this disease is real and takes our children any day of the week...for every person who reads this heart gripping story may they feel empowered to donate to the cause so that no more children and young adults are lost to this terrible disease...we were the lucky to survive it but we battle it's awful side effects and the encompassing fear of it's return every day of our lives...may others learn from this book and may they feel the need to help whereever they can! Thanks for the great review...I was really on the fence as to the value this book would add to my life-your review helped me to see that maybe I am just not yet ready for it...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Gin, I think that is a really good point that I hadn't thought of. I hope this book brings awareness to the realities of cancer too. If donations to cancer research went up because of this novel I think that would be a brilliant thing.<br /><br />I just want to clarify as well, that I believe there is a difference between smart kids and unbelievable kids. As a high school English teacher, I have met my fair share of super smart kids. One of the things I appreciate about John Green is he doesn't ever treat his readership as if they are just another group of mindless teens.<br /><br />The point I made, and that many others have, is that these kids, and their dialogue, are beyond 'smart' bordering on unbelievable. I get that is a JG thing though, so whatever. I was more put off at the attempt to still portray them as inspirational, thoughtful survivors whilst claiming that as one of the annoying things about a typical cancer book.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Even though I'm one of the blessedly inexperienced readers who should be able to take an "easy" conclusion from TFiOS, I couldn't. Some of the characters do express inspirational messages -- from the cross-stitched encouragements, to everything in An Imperial Affliction, to the Facebook wall posts, to the things Hazel and Augustus say about being privileged to love one another -- but at some point, all of these conclusions ring false or are tragically proven wrong. I considered each of these hopeful conclusions in its turn, but was forced to reject all of them. At the end, all I was left with was the title. This tragedy has no beauty or value or meaning or purpose -- it is simply the empirical result of a fault in our stars. <br />I fail to see the inspiration or entertainment in this -- though it seems from the other reviews that some people can. Yet I have told people that I "loved" the book, simply because I allowed it to affect me more deeply than most other things I've read. But even in my childish inexperience, I felt wrong for finding it so beautiful.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hmm. It is interesting to me that you point out the book as having clean conclusions. I came away with a different feeling - I don't mean to disagree with you, it is simply interesting to me how people with (what sound like) similar backgrounds in experiences with premature terminal illness and death come away with such varied interpretations.<br /><br />I feel like An Imperial Affliction really embodies a tattered ending - for all the beautiful phrases quoted from it, it ends midsentence and both the reader and Anna are denied knowing how the people in her life end up. I found that that rang very true for me in its tragedy and lack of fulfilling feeling.<br /><br />At the end of the book Hazel acknowledges that had they both been well, she and Gus are unlikely to have had a long-lasting relationship. Her pre-eulogy about an infinite space in a finite space is just that, a prepared eulogy for someone whose death she hasn't yet experienced.<br /><br />I agree that it seems like people are taking away an uplifting and positive message from the book, but I don't understand why. Between the behaviour of Gus' family and the constant references to how ill children are treated, I took away the feeling that something like these illnesses has the tendency to make people *want* to create these happy epithets and positive endings because of how incredibly, excruciatingly nihilistic and painful the whole thing is.<br /><br />I think Green at least tried to communicate that feeling to people who otherwise have not experienced that first hand. I haven't read many cancer-kid books because of how saccharine they are, but how many of them have the protagonist waking up in the ICU and hearing someone wailing down the hall and thinking "Someone's kid just died", or overhearing their mother saying "I won't be a mom anymore"? Green could have been more brutal, yes, and the ending could have been less of a miraculous post-death warm fuzzy message. But I didn't come away with anything resembling a warm fuzzy feeling about the beauty of a short life, and I don't think my own experience with cancer is the reason for that.<br /><br />I hope we're both wrong and, like Manasi, most people react to Green's writing the way I did and come away with a feeling that "this tragedy has no beauty or value or meaning or purpose", because I believe that to be the truth.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I really appreciate you dishing your personal thoughts, I had wondered how someone with personal experience would feel about the story. <br /><br />My completely unfounded opinions: <br />I actually did not get the impression that this book was turning tragedy into "YA entertainment." I have always felt that John Green attempts to raise YA to a new level of seriousness. The kind of serious that is reality; yes there is tragedy, suicide, senseless pain. But there is also cleverness, ridiculous dialogue, humor, etc. Whether he has succeeded at this or not is personal opinion. <br /><br />As you said, those of us who are so unbelievably fortunate as to have not experienced this kind of loss, will *never* understand the incredible pain. JG perhaps gave us the tiniest taste of it, and it reduced us all to puddles of tears. Not one reader is under the illusion they have now experienced the pain of losing a friend/daughter/son/etc to cancer. Knowing that we were so affected by fictional characters that we spent 4 hours with gives us just a glimpse of the monster of pain involved in losing someone.<br /><br />I do agree that JG slips back into the heroic survivors philosophy. Despite Augustus' supposed loss of dignity, he manages to point out this fact in a sentence more clever than most people can manage in their lives ;)<br /><br />As a side note, people will never understand the pain of rape, drug addiction, abuse, cancer, racism, etc. purely through reading. It's impossible. But it's as close as we get.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA["Whose story is this to tell?" is a question that often comes up when discussing postcolonial or minority literature, but I think it's interesting to pose the question about other themes such as illness. I know that John has experience dealing with cancer patients, but he chose to narrate this story from the point of view of the patient. In asking if it's his story to tell, it's also raising the question of if he is capable of realistically portraying what it's like to be terminally ill at 17. I don't know the answer to that question, but I do know that it can be frustrating when a book that purports to tell a story similar to your own strays drastically from your own experience. Maybe there isn't always a positive outlook when dealing with cancer and I can see how claiming that there is or that there should be might ring false to people who have lived with cancer in their lives.]]></body>

She does not seem to have a problem so much with the fact that it was written, but the way it was written. As you can see by the stars next to my name I loved the book! But I can't imagine anyone daring to come into her space and say that she 'missed the point'. Guess what, cancer HAS NO POINT. That was one of the ideas Green ultimately failed to follow through on, and Rhi has every right to call him out on it. Our lost loved ones did not die to give other people a new way of looking at anything; they just died.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thank you so much for writing this review. I've been wanting to read this book, but am at the same time hesitant as I know the darkness of serious illness at a young age. To read a book where an author could be misrepresenting what it's like due to inexperience or "hollywooding" the issue too much would make me pretty annoyed and a waste of money. I doubt the author meant to make the issue at all laughable, but when it's something close to the heart..this can be a book approached with careful feet for those with personal experience. Thanks for writing your review!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Jessica wrote: ""Whose story is this to tell?" is a question that often comes up when discussing postcolonial or minority literature, but I think it's interesting to pose the question about other themes such as il..."</i><br /><br />You know, I've never really thought about male authors writing from the voice of a female before. If I think about it too much, I become a little uncomfortable with it. But I think that is my hardcore extreme feminist side taking over. Because really, anybody can give voice to anything. <br />Do I think in some circumstances they shouldn't? I would have to say yes. (For a contemporary example, I had real issues with The Help as a novel.)<br />I suspect this novel would have been completely different had it been from Hazel's fathers voice. I also suspect, although this is of course entirely my opinion, that I would have found the novel a little more appropriate. Of course, even then, it still wouldn't have been a personal experience, as far as I am aware Green hasn't lost any children to terminal cancer. I think Gin commented above on how you never truly understand it unless you are the parent yourself. <br />My experience is based in losing a sibling. I can't contemplate what it would be like as a parent. But I do know I would never in a million years suggest my mother read this. She lives with the hopelessness of losing my brother every day, so for a novel that is so easily interpreted as trying to suggest an alternative conclusion to the hopelessness, it would be quite preposterous to her. <br />(I think this may be a very poorly constructed sentence!)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I lost my mother when I was young (it was sudden, not cancer-related), and I often find myself attracted to stories with a similar sort of plot. I don't read messages in them or try to interpret them, necessarily, but I relate emotionally and that's what I like about them. If you don't relate emotionally, then all bets are off. <br /><br />It occurs to me that I didn't read this book as arguing against the hopelessness of Hazel and Augustus's situation. I think there were definitely moments when the kids did feel like it was a hopeless situation - clearly, that was the tone of the letter that Augustus wrote that prompted the "fault in our stars" response and Hazel's parents did send her to the support group because they thought she was depressed. I also think that they didn't want to feel like that, that they wanted their lives to be about something else besides their disease and its inherent hopelessness - that's evident in their eulogies for each other and Augustus's anger that his name would never be famous. The "message" that I ended up taking away from this was more about accepting that there are things you can't change regardless of how good you are or how hard you try or how much you want it. Sometimes when the stars line up, they do so in a way that's hurtful and you have to find a way to make peace with that if you are going to survive that hurt. To me, there's a difference between looking for an alternative to hopelessness - as you put it - and an acceptance of it. That aspect of the story reminded me of things I've dealt with in my life that are wildly unrelated to teens with cancer and that was what I appreciated about it from an emotional standpoint. I separated that message from the cancer, but I can definitely see how that's not always an option for a reader. <br /><br />On another point entirely: I don't get upset by male authors writing a female voice per se, but I do often find that there is something inauthentic about it. I often just like those characters less. Some men do it well enough, but others (ahem, John Updike) should stick to their own kind.]]></body>

And this book gave me comfort and a new perspective of how my friends may have felt. Hazel's attitude is very similar to that of one of the friends that I lost! I'm sorry for offending you, but I clearly stated that I was not trying to offend anyone, and that my comment should have been taken lightly. I'm just sticking up for what I think is an absolutely flawless book.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Good, honest review. These are ethical issues that need to be discussed. I find it irritating that so many feel the need to argue with you and try to change your mind. I am completely deaf and books like Wonderstruck while excellent don't strike me as the real thing. It's written from the outside in rather than the inside out. I don't know why people are so resistant to hearing that. Teens (and adults who read YA)relate to suffering in a general sense. There is a romance to it. It's not actual experience. I'm in no great rush to read this book. Best wishes to you.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I see where you're coming from, in your review, but I think that there is such thing as a book being TOO realistic. A book that shows the ultimate hopelessness of young death simply wouldn't sell. Nobody would want to read a book that shed no ray of hope. It sounds like you would have only desired a book that would have been too grim, too overwhelming for a person to read. <br /><br />I gave this book to my friend whose parents died from cancer. She adored it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I have read your review and I understand why you gave it the stars. Although it was very hard for me to read it too, I think you summed up my feelings towards some aspect to the book. I respect your views and thank you for stating your opinion on the book. I think you helped me understand the loss of a loved one at such a young age. <br />I lost my grandmother to cancer two years ago and let's just say this was not a light read, although there were some parts of it which were very light, even with the subject of the book being a bit heavy. <br />All I'm saying here is that I thank you for your review and am sorry for your loss.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I am a stage 3 cancer survivor, and I have to say that this book mirrored many of my feelings that I have never articulated to anyone, you always feel as if you are the bomb. I have to admit that gallows humor got me thru a lot of surgery, chemo and radiation. I am still alive, and Hazel and Gus are not, but I feel better having met them, metaphoricaly speaking.]]></body>

There are some books that I simply cannot read because they are far too heavy for me as a reader. I respect your opinion, and your review, and I really enjoyed reading your thoughts on this book.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I found your review very thoughtful and I'm very sorry for you're loss, but one thing that irked me about your review and comments was that you called it entertainment and you wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Books don't have to be entertaining to be valuable, while i have no claim that i somehow know how you feel, I definitely think this book has helped me empathize with the death of a loved one(something i haven't yet truly had to deal with) and, in my personal opinion, this would definitely be a reason to read it. It doesn't have to be pleasant.]]></body>
