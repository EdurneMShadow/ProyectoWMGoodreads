  <description>Will Grayson meets Will Grayson. One cold night, in a most unlikely corner of Chicago, two strangers are about to cross paths. From that moment on, their world will collide and lives intertwine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not that far from Evanston to Naperville, but Chicago suburbanites Will Grayson and Will Grayson might as well live on different planets. When fate delivers them both to the same surprising crossroads, the Will Graysons find their lives overlapping and hurtling in new and unexpected directions. With a push from friends new and old - including the massive, and massively fabulous, Tiny Cooper, offensive lineman and musical theater auteur extraordinaire - Will and Will begin building toward respective romantic turns-of-heart and the epic production of history's most awesome high school musical.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Arlene, I felt exactly the same way about everything you just said! I couldn't STAND Tiny. At all. But I really liked John Green's Will Grayson...and went in and out with David Levithan's. In the end, both won me over...but I gave it 3 stars. I just felt like it wasn't as good as John Green's other books, and that it had the potential to be AMAZING. It was still good and all, I just haaaaated the Tiny Dancer play and how it took up so much of the book. Also, I thought it could've been a little more thought-provoking. I mean, this book tackled topics that haven't really been hit by John Green before...and the stereotype-cliched-joke of a character, Tiny, ruined the story for me a little. Oh, well! I still enjoyed the read, as always. JOHN GREEN &lt;3]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[LOL Steven... whew! I thought I was going to get slammed on my review for h8ing on Tiny Cooper. hahahaha Yes, the play.. WT??!! I still have it in my head..."My name is Will Grayson, and I appreciate Tiny Cooper!" *shakes head* It is funny though... gotta give it that.<br /><br />I didn't care for WG#2 for quite some time and then his reveal kinda melted my heart and I felt sorry for him. He was just sooo harsh but at times funny.<br /><br />I'm a fan of John Green... what can I say?? :)<br /><br />Happy reading Steven and I'm glad you liked the book too. :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Yes I agree, Tiny is QUITE the stereotypical gay, in a bad way. There are super flamboyant HEY-GUESS-WHAT-GUYS-IM-A-HOMOSEXUAL-SO-DEAL-WITH-IT-OR-ILL-PROTEST-AND-REPORT-YOU-TO-SOME-ORGANIZATION-YOUVE-NEVER-HEARD-OF gays, but also the mellow ones that are pretty chilled out. I have a best friend who's gay-- they're not in your face about it at all. Tiny is an embarassment to gays but he has his funny moments. Overall, this was a great book that helped me find myself along with the characters.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Agreed it was a great book Mason. Tiny just came off a bit self-serving as much as he said he wasn't. I'm fine with a touch of flamboyance. It can actually be refreshing when it's sincere. I have a couple of friends that flaunt their stuff and I adore them, but at the same time they care deeply for others and I didn't get that from Tiny. Glad you enjoyed the book too Mason. :D]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I have to agree with your whole review except for 2 things:<br /><br />1) I felt very connected to WG2 right off the bat, i liked his internet connection with isaac and the way he felt when he talked to him (or i should say her considering it was really Maura all along) I guess because I've been there, and have felt depressed and have felt like you don't deserve anything and I have literally said the things he says to Tiny to some people in my life... It was actually quite strange to read. I feel like David really captured something real. I was right there with him the whole time, regardless of whether I agreed or not. As much as when he broke up with Tiny I was internally screaming at him to stop it, move, run after him, tell him you care! it didn't matter, because I understood why he didn't do any of that... I've been in positions that I have yelled at myself to do thing, knowing i should, but just couldn't bring myself to because I felt so depressed. It happens, and I think it is so true and so real that it truly moved me.<br /><br />2) I liked Tiny, as opposed to all the people here that say he ruined it. I didn't mind him. Actually, he reminded me a lot of someone I know/knew in high school. He too was gay and in drama and he too directed/produced/starred in his own musical! how crazy is that? He wasn't overweight, and he wasn't sensitive, in fact, he was kind of a jerk. Now Tiny on the other hand, picked up the pieces where my.. acquaintance... literally dropped the ball. I feel like even though he was this flamboyant, bigger-than-life, over-the-top character, he was humanized. He had his faults, and I don't think he was pompous, in fact, my favourite part of this whole book may have been when he went over to talk to Maura for Will... when he thanked her for bringing them together. I felt like that is something I would have done regardless of Will dragging me the other way. I felt that it was very real and very raw, just pure emotion, like he didn't think it through but didn't need or want to- he just wanted to do it (which is what I do sometimes too, and I think what everyone does sometimes....) <br /><br />Anyways, that's my rant... I really liked this book and I don't really have anything negative to say about it, except maybe it didn't make me think as much as some of John's other work. Even Looking For Alaska made me think a lot more, and when I was finished with it I began looking for my Great Perhaps. With WGWG I just feel satisfied and kind of emotional, which is really not a bad thing to feel after finishing a book. I think I agree when you said you're not sure how to feel. I laughed, I frowned, I smiled, and I felt a lot while reading, and I guess now I just feel satisfied, like the story has ended, there is closure, and I feel good about it.<br /><br />I hope some of that made some sense lol]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This was a really fun book to read. I really like how it's a book written by two authors, and the characters that they created represent each author. It was like having a combined one-hour special of two of your favorite TV shows combined.<br />I've never read something of that sort, so it was very interesting to read because of the new style. Both Wills are made to be complete opposites, which makes this book so unique. I agree on the thoughts about Tiny Cooper. He seemed to be sometimes very annoying in my opinion, but not always. Overall, it is a fantastic masterpiece of two authors.]]></body>
