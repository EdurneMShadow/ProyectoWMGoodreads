  <description>&lt;b&gt;About three things I was absolutely positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Edward was a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there was a part of him—and I didn't know how dominant that part might be—that thirsted for my blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first book of the Twilight Saga, internationally bestselling author Stephenie Meyer introduces Bella Swan and Edward Cullen, a pair of star-crossed lovers whose forbidden relationship ripens against the backdrop of small-town suspicion and a mysterious coven of vampires. This is a love story with bite.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[I've read Twilight and I'm currently reading it's sequel, New Moon, and I have to say that I do agree with you on Meyers writing. I really find it so hard to WANT to pick up this book and finish it. Well, I want to finish it so I can move onto something else (I hate stopping mid-book) but I just find it so hard to care about what happens to Bella and Edward. I really do. Check out my actual review of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49041.New_Moon__The_Twilight_Saga__Book_2_" title="New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) by Stephenie Meyer" rel="nofollow">New Moon</a>, I go into even more scathing detail :P hehe. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49041.New_Moon" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49...</a>]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[A book worthy of a Pulitzer surely will be packed with details letting us know the characters better. The "pointless" details in Twilight were just that: pointless.<br /><br />However, I don't expect Pulitzer quality from every book I read. What DO I expect? A fully-developed plot, fully-drawn characters, and emotions that ring true. I found none of these things in Twilight. I also found it quite troubling that a book written by a woman, primarily FOR young women, that so many misogynistic points of view were put across.<br /><br />Sure, books are supposed to be for pleasure, but not at the expense of intelligence.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Well, it seems to me your versions of "pointless details" are any details that you yourselves decide are unneccesary, not even just details that have nothing to do directly with a character. &amp; no Cricket. My point was that "Pointless details", as described by some of you, are a large part of the reason that many books have won the Pulitzer. <br />Cricket, did you actually want me to count all the books I've read that have won the Pulitzer Prize? I could just count up all the well worn copies of Pulizer Prize winners on my shelves at home, but that wouldn't include half of the number I have read, or that I've read two or three or four times. Have you ever even cracked a peak in more than one or two? Anyway, like I said before, I read for pleasure, not so I can compare how many more books I've read than you, so I don't really care how many you have read. I think I am done with this conversation. I could point you onto pages and pages and pages of details within Pulitzer Prize winning books devoted exclusively to describing the look of a room, the details of a dress, the dirt in the crack of a floor board! Details that, by the way, have nothing to do with one of the characters directly! I honestly don't feel that any of you have a leg to stand on when it comes to your argument on the importance of these kinds of "pointless details" as you all are calling them. I'm not going to dissect Twilight and tell you what I think could have been left out and what truly added to it. My point is that I disagree with you on what are and what are not "pointless details", however well or badly it was written. I also stand by everything I said in my original comment.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[The details didn't seem pointless to me; they helped me feel like I was there in Bella's world. Most writers fight hard to add the details that let the readers feel as if they are there, watching at the least. I know authors can go overboard, but I didn't feel it was done excessively. I'm rather tired of books where you can guess the ending because every little detail has to be clueing you in. However, there isn't a book written that completely pleases everyone. That's fine too. It just means that you have to be able to take the insults along with the compliments when you're a writer.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Cricket, so are you purposely trying to prove my point for me? One of my points at least. This is hilarious! You have selected several specific details that you want me to prove that Meyer included in a specific part of the book. Otherwise, all other details she shared, at the very least in that scene, are pointless!? Thank you for proving me right in my comment above, when I said "Well, it seems to me your versions of "pointless details" are any details that you yourselves decide are unneccesary". Obviously, you feel this goes either way. Any random details, like "what color shirt she wore that day", that you feel should have been there and were not, can also mean that the book is pointless, or a lot of it! I really appreciated your comment though, Cricket. Some of my guesses about you, and the others on here who share your opinion, were right. Your comment was enlightening! Thank you!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[OMG Heidi, I love your comment! LOL! <br /><br />I agree that details make up the book. In details the readers are able to picture the scene so much better. <br /><br />Hmmm, I agree that it's nearly impossible to fall in love in a week, but people this is a FICTIONAL BOOK ABOUT VAMPIRES! Some of the allure they have for one another has nothing to do with realistic human qualities.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I love your review! I'm a middle school teacher, and my kids are freaks about this book, so I read them (all three). I wish a vampire would bite me, after reading them because thew were so boring! I don't care if she writes about cheese (which I think would be just as exciting)--you're correct, they are boring. And, Bella is a weak, pathetic character. <br /><br />Good work!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Great review! I just do not get the hype for this book. Actually if Bella wasn't in it I'd probably like it. And haha. The first thing I did after I read it was go post on my journal about it and I mentioned the stupidity of the granola bar. It just stuck with me. I mean why would anyone mention that in a book ever? ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I honestly can't remember a granola bar, and I've read it three times.<br /><br />The domestic details really didn't bother me. They worked to ground the story. It's a fantastical story, and the contrast between Bella as a regular girl and Edward as, well, a mythical creature, adds to a sense of <i>plausibility</i>. It's fantasy, but every fantasy book needs to possess at least a grain of reality in order to make it possible. It felt real, to me, even though it's not. A book works, for me, when I can disspell disbelief and fall through the rabbit-hole right into the story, and <i>feel</i> it. I'm always on the hunt for books like that, but everyone's different.<br /><br />But I can understand how details like the ones mentioned would get on your nerves, once noticed. Such things usually bug me only when I've already made up my mind not to like the book; then, everything's fair game to ridicule.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I know this is a little late, but I really wanted to reply to this comment.<br /><br /><i>So whether you were able to find the story BELIEVABLE or not demonstrates your lack of ability to realize you were reading a book about VAMPIRES!!!</i><br /><br />I really take issue with the notion that just because a book is a work of fantasy, it is automatically excused from attempting to make the characters and storyline convincing. The ability to make characters that are not human appear human, the ability to create a story anyone could relate to no matter how fantastic the circumstances...that takes talent, and shouldn't be brushed aside.<br /><br />I guess what I'm saying is that believability is NEVER something that should be limited to non-fiction. It is the ability to invoke empathy and understanding in the reader, making us see the characters are real, rather than words on a page, and that's a wonderful thing.<br /><br />I think the reviewer's desire to see this in a storyline and characters demonstrates a deep understanding of basic criteria for a great read, as well as an understanding of her own desires, which, in the end, matter most.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I find it rather amusing that Heidi (the first) and Nikki postured about reading all sorts of books, and how the details weren't pointless, but when asked for details that would have actually served to elaborate on the world, or to indicate books they've read that, like Twilight, had details given that had no bearing on the story at all, they failed to deliver.<br /><br />And then they fell into a bout of self-congratulations.<br /><br />What they failed to realize was that details such as the layout of the kitchen or the color of her shirt would stick with the reader, letting them feel more a part of the world than simply knowing what she ate that morning. How can you feel a part of her environment, or aware of her surroundings, if you don't know what they are?<br /><br /><br /><br />..anyway, I agree with the review.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Joshua...you obviously failed to see my point at all! Did you even read what I wrote, or were you just so anxious to write what you thought was a clever little comment that it became easy for you to ramble aimlessly? What self-congratulations? I believe someone suggested something about me that was absolutely far from any truth, so I felt compelled to straighten that out. I'm not sure why. I almost wish I'd never posted anything on this comment, but then what would you guys have to talk about? I think some of you need to get a life, or write a book yourself if you think you're such a genius. I'm all for the details, but I don't think a writer is required to describe everything in every room , along with every stitch of every article of clothing, etc., in order for it to be an enjoyable book. If you don't like it, don't read it. One of my favorite books is Margaret Mitchell's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18405.Gone_With_The_Wind" title="Gone With The Wind by Margaret Mitchell" rel="nofollow">Gone With The Wind</a>. I love detail, but I can enjoy a wide variety of writing styles. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[And remember, kiddies.<br /><br />If you spout "If you don't like it, don't read it" here in regards to those who didn't enjoy Twilight..<br /><br />..there are two problems with that statement.<br /><br />1. If you don't like a review that downs Twilight, by your own 'logic,' you shouldn't read it.<br /><br />2. How would anyone know if they won't like it if they haven't read it? Some of us might have expected it to be what you fans claim it to be, only to find that you were vastly mistaken.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Well, I really am done here. I usually get a notice in my in box if someone leaves a comment after a response I've posted. I'll have to just start deleting the one's I'm no longer interested in. I was just trying to be considerate, and read others responses as well. Good luck with your books Joshua. I really do wish you the best. Why would I not?<br /><br />p.s. I should have said "don't read it again", or you could have quit it after realizing you hate it, however long that took you. Just don't waste your time with it if it isn't benefitting you or others for you to be reading it. The best thing you can do for others, by the way, is to point them toward the best books, not waste time picking apart the crap ones. Just a bit of friendly advice.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Actually, it's kind of a odd topic regarding good and bad books.<br /><br />If you don't read the bad stuff, you'll not be able to appreciate the good ones. It's like joy and sadness. You'll never know one unless you've encountered the other.<br /><br />And if you don't pick apart the bad stuff, you might run the risk of encountering the same pitfalls within your own writing.<br /><br />Plus, if no one picks apart the crap books, then there won't be any bad reviews to warn potential readers of what they're getting themselves into.<br /><br />If everyone only commented on the things they liked, there would be no warnings available for those who don't share the same tastes.<br /><br />I don't go to the reviews of fans of books I don't like, telling them they're wrong, even though it's a matter of taste. Shame fans don't give the same courtesy toward those who don't share their fandom.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thank you! I completely agree. Though I have been known to compound readers with details in the past, even the smallest hole in a character's shoe has meaning. Twilight was drabble. It got me addicted as I'm sure it did every other teenage girl in America but it's a deeply flawed novel. <br /><br />No better than a Mary Sue.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Heidi<br />"Pointless details" can be a good thing. IF--and I did say if--there are "pointless details" about everything. If there is a pointless detail about what color shirt she wore, or what her kitchen looks like, sure, those kind of "She ate a granola bar for breakfast" deatails can be fine. But when you don't even know what her kitchen looks like until the end of the book, but you know that she had a granola bar for breakfast in the beginning, you have a problem. She added some VERY pointless details at the beginning before adding details that may have added to the story.]]></body>

If people would read it not trying to enjoy the story but really being logical and thinking about flaws and mistakes, you would really see that it's not a very good book at all.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Do you expect her to just jump right into the climax within the first page of the book? She couldn't do that. There'd be nothing to wait for, no suspense. Bella and Edward's relationship had to grow and she had to know more about him before something dramatic happened. (I'm referring to the situation with James, not the whole car crash thing.) Granted, what she ate in the morning was pointless. But I believe she was trying to imply that she was in a hurry to go somewhere (possibly to Edward's home...?) and that she didn't have enough time to eat a regular breakfast. It helps the reader get more "into" the story, I suppose.]]></body>

Something that the readers are waiting for. And then Meyer has this plot that's just half-hazardly put in, and you can't even be happy with the ending!]]></body>

They are in loveeee!" stage, simply influenced by the fact that Meyer added in a few too many adjectives for "sexy" and descriptions of his eyes and whatnot...which in return seem to act as some sort of drug that puts tween girls and (unfortunately) even "grown" women in a Twilight-induced coma.]]></body>
