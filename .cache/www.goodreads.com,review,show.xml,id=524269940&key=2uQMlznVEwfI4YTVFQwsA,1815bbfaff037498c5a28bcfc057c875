  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?</description>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>"I hated the way the story develops in the second part of the book, and I especially hated the way that it ends. I hated the pointlessness of the story – why does it need to be told? What does it accomplish? What does it say about us, as people?"</i><br /><br />This is exactly how I felt while I read this book. I couldn't stop turning the pages fast enough during the first part because I was so curious about the twist everyone was talking about. I was so excited about this twist that I was feeling pretty lukewarm when it was finally revealed. I mean, sure, the twist was a good one when I think about it now but I just felt kind of meh about it because I expected so much more. It's like all the hype revolved around the twist in this story and I just didn't understand any of it. <br /><br />After the twist this whole story turned into ridiculousness at its finest and I was wondering if everyone else read a different book than I did.<br /><br />I don't mind when the characters aren't likeable in a book but then I expect at least an interesting plot. But I didn't even care for the plot after a while, if I didn't make a habit out of always finishing books even if they annoy the heck out of me, I wouldn't have finished this one. It was readable during the first part and I flipped through the pages pretty fast but in the end it took me <i>two</i> weeks to finish <i>Gones Girl</i> (usually I read books in 1-3 days, depending my mood and how much time I have).<br /><br />Long story short: A great review for a book that doesn't live up to the hype.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I would never have read the book with a plot like that anyway - but now I really hate that this book and its visions are so well received that a lot of readers will dip into this miasma and feel a bit more befouled in their life. Life is too difficult a lot of the time to take on additional dirt.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Nick is still douchetastically pathetic.</i><br /><br />Ba ha ha!<br /><br />I think both of your reviews are well-written and I had a much different take on this novel. I liked Nick a lot more than you two did, despite his faults. I definitely needed a shower after reading this but I loved how well the author manipulated my emotions. I think Amy is brilliant but she is very damaged emotionally, so I bought her returning to Nick.<br /><br />Thanks for teaching me the word "epistolary"!]]></body>

I would definitely need a shower after visiting a few hours with these people.<br /><br />Cannot imagine spending the time needed to write a book like this -- way too much time with YUCK people.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA["In summation: I devoured Gone Girl but I fucking hated it. " <br /><br />Ditto! I was extremely disappointed in this book especially with all its hype &gt;:( <br />I feel a lot of authors give up at the end of their stories. They've become too invested in "mind blowing" the reader with twists and turns and they don't put enough heart into the ending.<br /><br />I feel as if Amy's story isn't over as there was no discussion about Desi's timeline matching Amy's. You mean to tell me throughout the whole novel the police follow strict protocol (and constantly remind Nick of said protocol following), including carefully look into backgrounds and alibi's of Desi, Hilary, and Tommy, and then at the end they just believe Amy's tale of her abduction...? My gut feeling is Desi's mother could easily put him at other events that would have discrepancy with Amy's timeline. Again with the quick ending the reader is left with so many unanswered questions, especially what info Rhonda had to tell Nick when he decided to throw in the wet towel. I also don't think Amy is quite finished with Nick yet...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[These two reviews combined are perfect. I was really excited about this book after all the hype, and all I knew about the plot was what was in the movie trailers. What a disappointment. I am so baffled by some of the turns the book took, particularly the free pass on Nick's misogyny throughout because his wife ended up being the crazy bitch all men fear getting stuck with, and the logical inconsistencies with Amy's "brilliance." Terribly bummed I wasted a day on this.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I enjoyed reading your reviews but I thought that there was a darkly comic undertone to most of the novel, kind of like the movie, Very Bad Things, where everyone turns out to be a douchebag and everyone ends up getting screwed over. I felt you took it way more seriously than it took itself. I couldn't help but read it knowing that at places Gillian Flynn was writing it with a massive grin on her face.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I really liked the book, but I can see where you're coming from here. Also 100% agree that the book is kinda antifeminist ... I was reminded of what Susan Faludi wrote about "Fatal Attraction" way back in the 1980s. (Also very true about Nick being oddly anachronistic, LOL. I almost didn't notice because I am myself a technologically inept 30-year-old)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I wanted to respond to Ana's comment: "Nick concocts his own plan to make Amy change her mind and come back...AND IT WORKS." I don't see this as inconsistent with the logic of the narrative. I think Amy knew EXACTLY what Nick was doing, and she liked it, as in this quote from Amy: "Give me a man with a little fight in him, a man who calls me on my bullshit. (But who also kind of likes my bullshit.)" I enjoyed reading your passionate review. :)]]></body>
