  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Ian wrote: "Nataliya, do you think that those of us who didn't enjoy the first novel will enjoy the second and third? I know sometimes authors can improve."</i><br /><br />Ian, I don't think so. The style remains very similar, and so does the degree of suspension of disbelief that you need to have in order to enjoy it. I think she gets better in the third book, but not enough to make you enjoy it if the first novel did not grab you. The three books read like three connected parts of the whole, and you not liking the first is likely a good indicator that you will not enjoy the rest.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Kat wrote: "I must confess that I cannot relate to Katniss' walking-wounded mindset.

But Katniss is a seventeen-year-old girl who has been through too much in too short of a time, and was thrust into all of that completely unprepared. Her reaction seems very appropriate. From what I have seen of teens who have been through rather traumatic experiences, she is acting just like one would expect. I do think that if she were older and more experienced, she could have lived up to your definition of badass.<br /><br />On a very unrelated side note - every time I see Clint Eastwood's name, I automatically think of Roland Deschain from Stephen King's "The Dark Tower" series.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Kat wrote: "If Katniss were in ear reach of me, I would tell her so. But only after I had given her a momma bear hug."</i><br /><br />You know, I think that's a huge part of Katniss' issues and her slow recovery from the huge mental trauma. She has NOBODY to give her a momma bear hug. <br /><br />Her mother abandoned her completely after Prim's death, staying in District 4 because she could not bear coming back. Just like she checked out after Katniss' father died, leaving her twelve-year-old daughter to recover from this trauma on her own. The mother abandoned Katniss twice in the times of greatest need! And her best friend Gale - disappearing without a word, abandoning her as well. Only Peeta eventually came around, with severe mental injuries as well.<br /><br />With love and support, Katniss may have done much better. Even though I do hope that despite what appears to be incomplete recovery, she still has more good days than bad days.]]></body>

I think it's easy to misjudge and misunderstand her actions and motivations, but in the end for me it was a very believable and sad way to end this story. I loved how Collins wrapped it up, and I loved Katniss to pieces.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I can appreciate this point of view, and I do need to reread this book seeing as the first (and only) time I read it I strongly disliked it. I was rushing to finish it just to get it over with, because the more I had to live inside of Katniss’s head with her trauma, the more uncomfortable I got. Not to mention love triangles are a cliche that put a bad taste in my mouth without fail, so the whole Gale v.s. Peeta crap was annoying to the bitter end. I don’t think my opinion of that will ever change, though, and the only reason I could stand to finish the entire trilogy was that the love triangle wasn’t even close to being the point of the story, so at least there’s that.<br /><br />I’ve got this mindset where, in the best stories, the protagonist is the “hero,” and I want the hero to have some sort of hopeful ending, especially if they’ve been through a lot of crap. To me, Mockingjay just kind of ended with Katniss and Peeta in limbo. And it makes sense, given everything they’ve been through. It just wasn’t really what I was looking for in this series at the end of the day. Again, I’m gonna give this and the other two books (which I liked) a closer read, to see if I can’t get a better understanding and appreciation for it. As of now I really can’t stand this book. I was talking about it with a friend earlier, then decided to check out some GR reviews to see varying opinions, and to see if others touched on the things I didn’t care for, such as the deaths that I personally found superfluous. <br /><br />At the end of the day I think that I read mainly to escape the real world, not to be reminded of it. Mockingjay was strikingly true to life. There wasn’t one moment where I blamed Katniss for any of her feelings. I did get tired of it, though, and even though it was painful I hung on. I want to read her story again to see if can’t work through my discomfort and try to appreciate it for what it is. As it stands I still strongly dislike Mockingjay, but maybe that will change if I can break myself out of my escapism bubble and try to appreciate what you call the “survivor,” rather than looking for my “hero” which I seem to default at. It might help to read this with different expectations, and knowing what I’m in for helps.<br /><br />That being said, I enjoyed reading your review. Thanks for sharing your thoughts.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[@ Larisa: I can easily understand how the atmosphere of 'Mockingjay' can be off-putting to readers. I think you pinpointed it very well - Katniss is a survivor instead of a hero, which is somewhat of a change from the first two books. This switch in emphasis worked for me - and clearly disappointed many others.<br /><br />Thanks for your excellent comment!]]></body>

I can imagine how - had I been waiting for it to be released for some time, I may have been disappointed, too (that's probably exactly what happened with GRRM's 'A Dance with Dragons' - the expectations were built up and the book did not deliver what I expected). But I was lucky enough to read all three back-to-back and therefore had no time in which to build up predictions and expectations.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Oh it makes me feel better to know that I'm not the only one who seriously suffered some form of PTSD after this series ended. It affected me more than any book I've ever read. The bittersweet ending couldn't have been any different, and I agree 100% with your review (which puts into words what I wanted to say, only better!). And the part about Katniss and how strong she was, the ultimate survivor... I think every reader pretty much is both grateful they didn't have to endure what she did and also hopeful that they could be half as strong as she was in this book. Loved the review.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with you, Nat and my heart pains for Katniss. But what I love most about the book is that it's realistic. There are no magical recoveries and no easy letting go business. Hunger Games Trilogy, my prized possession.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Natalyia, thank you for your fine review. It's the best about this book I read so far.<br />BTW, the book dind't give me PTSD; rather, it revealed me I HAVE PTSD and I AM (kind of) a survivor, similarly to Katniss. <br />Here lies the power of a story and of a character: to mirror who you are. And that's why we love reading good stories.]]></body>

I hope you are finding ways to deal with your PTSD; it's a very difficult condition to live with and it affects all aspects of life. I hope you are getting the help and support you need to help you overcome it. Good luck!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I was so angry with the author by the time she killed Prim, I stopped the audiobook and deleted it from my phone. The way she killed off Finnick and treated poor Peeta, it was like she was tired of the book, the series, and the characters and wanted to be shed of them any way possible. I wonder if maybe she was a writer for the tv series "Lost."<br /><br />I can picture it now. <br /><br />"I don't know how to end this series." <br /><br />"I know. I'll just kill everybody off."<br /><br />"What about the millions of people who have become so vested in the story lines and the characters? Won't they be upset?"<br /><br />"Let them eat goat cheese apple tarts."]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[@ Randall: You know, deciding to kill off characters does not mean the author is 'tired of book , the series'. George R.R. Martin was applauded for doing just that in his 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series. Not every character gets to live happily ever after, as much as people who love those characters would want them to.<br /><br />Even though I'm still sad about poor Finnick...]]></body>
