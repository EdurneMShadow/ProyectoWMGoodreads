  <description>Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and inspiring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids. Along the way he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles along the way. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Mmmmm...you know, I didn't even notice the female perspective or lack thereof in this book. I didn't like it because I thought it was hokey and, it seemed to me, to be talking down to its audience. You want follow your dream stuff for adults? Read Joseph Campbell, not this inane piece of fluff. Someone who usually has excellent recommendations suggested this to me: what a disappointment!]]></body>

I'm old and proud of it; I've read lots of books of all sorts; I'm entitled to not like things such as this and I have not and will not read any of the others by this author -- I have toooo many books to read as it is.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[i consider myself pretty jaded, and a feminist to boot. i'll admit that in my most recent re-reading of this book, coehlo's treatment of women didn't sit well with me at all, and i had the same issues with fatima being simply part of santiago's legend and not having any of her own hopes or dreams independent of him. <br /><br />and yet... there's something about this book that i just can't shake. it's hokey, it's totally unrealistic, and it's message is heavy handed and not especially clever. but right now, the message that most stands out for me is that it's okay to be selfish when it comes to following your dreams. probably not what coehlo intended, and definitely not an option for everyone, but there's something affirming and honest about that desire. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hmmm... I don't see what about this character's journey couldn't be made by a woman. I think its just circumstantial that the main character is male. Even if Coehlo is a sexist what in his "follow your dreams" message excludes women?<br /><br />I wouldn't consider a book like this sexist. Its too easy for anyone to identify with the main character's experience. Both men and women rave about this book for that very reason. I find it hard to say that something with such universal appeal to both sexes is sexist.<br /><br />Sure Fatima is a weak character. All that demonstrates to me is that Coehlo didn't put any depth in his novel. It is quite obvious that he didn't. I mean this book is no deeper than the thin little pages the words are printed on. There's nothing there. Given how shallow this message and story are... I don't get how you could read so much into it.<br /><br />Still I do agree... other than Santiago and that cool dude selling glasses at the top of the hill... the characters in this book are flat. Its like the whole world only exists to serve Santiago.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Although I agree with first post and am usually one of the first to look for the anti-woman in the traditional story, this book was more like a little reminder for an inner journey. The points that struck home were that we choose whether to listen to intuition or to reject it, and that our real treasure can be found "where we came from" whether that means at home or within. <br />I read this book like I read all those "inspirational" email forwards. I didn't take it too seriously because it was so short. <br />Maybe it appealed to me most to read about the desert while I sat bundled up in my cold winter town. :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Awesome review, Sithara. I would have burned out some brain cells if I tried to list the reasons that I found the message of this book random, disconnected and hollow. It does have a message, just not for me. I could recommend it to some, if pressed, but for me it was just a flat and anticlimactic story.<br />Also, was anyone else 'wowed' by his treasure, once he found it?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I see your point and agree with your as far as the female perspective lacking in this book. Although, we do have to consider the location and time period. I don't think I'd go as far to say that Coelho is fine with disregarding women. In the context of his story and maintaining consistency with the setting, I think it was appropriate to leave out the female's perspective. To do otherwise I think would've been out of place and confused his point.<br /><br />Personally, I would have been pissed if "all the universe conspired" to get me to leave everything behind and cross that desert only to find out that my treasure was at home. Seems a bit time consuming and unnecessary if you ask me.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Being a male, I guess I never even noticed the lack of female "personal legend". You're right though. <br />You said though that those who stay at home to raise kids, etc, giving up on their dreams are equally heroic is so true,but in truth I think that this was the message of the book, ultimately. That you can search the whole world for your personal legend when in fact it resides in your own back yard. That it resides within each of us, not outside of ourselves. The sad thing is that most people HAVE to search the world over in order to learn this valuable truth. ]]></body>

I'm also a feminists of sorts but it's just a book and you take from it what is important to you. At least thats how I do it anyway. The book "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6288.The_Road" title="The Road by Cormac McCarthy" rel="nofollow">on the road</a>" actually made me stop reading because of it's treatment of women...maybe I just wasn't that interested anyway.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[The feminism you are describing is not feminism. It is misandry.<br /><br />You are blaming Coelho for writing a story about the protagonists personal legend and his pursuit of the legend.<br /><br />You believe it is somehow sexist for their not to be an equal legend for Fatima.<br /><br />If you would like that story, write it. This book is no more sexist than a narrative with a lead female protagonist. <br /><br />Your review is misandry, thinly disguised as Feminism. You automatically assume that Fatima has no personal legend because of a sexist slight by Coelho without considering that the limitations of the character are cultural, not sexual. She may be following her personal legend, simply because it does not fit your narrow paradigm you reject it as sexist.<br /><br />In short, you clearly understand very little about either.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I don't think this is hugely sexist, but I do agree with your comment on responsibility. In our world it is very irresponsible to just leave and waste money on a voyage as such, whilst people in other situations are working their butts off to put food on the table, as you said. Personally, I just kept waiting and waiting for a big thing to happen and open my eyes and 20 pages till the end of the book I realised it was just all the same bland story.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I think you have completely missed the point of the book. Fatima stays behind to one day achieve her personal legend. Was she supposed to tag along on his compromising hers? Would that have been a better plot? No, because Coelho would contradict himself. The story is not about Fatima. The three characters happen to be men, this is also in a different culture and time period.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[My sentiments with this book exactly. Although I understand the cultural context in which this story took place, but I guess the problem was the writer's skill was lacking is explaining the other facets of this "personal legend" thing. What about the personal legends of those women in the desert? <br /><br />I find the conclusion really bland, I was expecting something more of a twist or more well-rounded, than just the boy finally finding his treasure and going back to the desert for Fatima. <br /><br />This was a good book until the last few chapters.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[The story isn't about Fatima. It's about Santiago. The fact that Fatima DIDN'T go with him speaks to her character. She didn't give up her own life and dreams to follow the man she loved around the world. She stayed. They did not have a family together nor were they yet married. Santiago needed to do his thing before moving ahead with family life. Maybe more people should appreciate that.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This book is not sexist because it is about a male character and not a female character. It's also not sexist because the character of Fatima is underdeveloped. It's sexist because "The desert takes our men from us, and they don't always return. We know that, and we are used to it. Those who don't return... they become part of the Soul of the World. Some do come back. And then the other women are happy because they believe that their men may one day return, as well. I used to look at those women and envy them their happiness. Now, I too will be one of the women who wait." And, "The boy fell to his knees and wept. He thanked God for making him believe in his Personal Legend, and for leading him to meet a king, a merchant, an Englishman, and an alchemist. And above all for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love would never keep a man from his Personal Legend." There are many ways the action of the story could have been exactly the same without the description of what and why being such BS. Fatima doesn't stay home because she has her own live and her own Personal Legend that is there; she commits to wait for him, making her whole life about waiting for a man who might never return. Eff that noise.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I like how you did your review: It's for you if you are attracted to such and such statements. That seems to be the issue with people who really loved it and those that hated it (and seem to bicker on here). <br /><br />I also completely agree with the sexism. I didn't sit well with me at all that Fatima's Personal Legend was meeting her husband or that no other female characters are entertained as having any such dreams. You expressed my exact concerns here.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I can't even finish this book, it was recommended by another woman. Just goes to show the patriarchal ideology embedded in society. I'm at the part where fatima waits for her man while she continues the same chores she's done for years. I love self help books but since learning more and more about women's exclusion in the world participating in crap like this just reinforces these damaging gendered stereotypes. Great review, we need to wake the fuck up]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I just finished reading, and thought of myself as Fatima and another, or maybe many others, as the shepherd. I can see where some might have problems with the "sexism" in this story, but flexible perspective can help you derive insight from just about anything. I'm sorry that you were unable to see past those issues to take anything meaningful from this. I don't believe it was perfect, but I found joy and wisdom within many aspects.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I totally dislike women who does not like any book, etc... because it does not have a female role model. That is not what this story is about. It's about finding your true self, path, heart in life. Maybe it was too simple of a story for some comprehend. Quit over thinking a book and enjoy it for what it is.]]></body>
