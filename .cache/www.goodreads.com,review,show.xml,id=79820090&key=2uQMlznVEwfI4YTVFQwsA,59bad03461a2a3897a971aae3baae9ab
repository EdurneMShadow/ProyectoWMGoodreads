  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[T - <br />I wasn't thrilled by the book, but neither did I hate it. Collins did go dark in this one, which is probably why it didn't rate 5 stars for me . Some of the deaths didn't get their full share of pathos (Finnick), some people lived who should have died (Gale). Sometimes the story seemed like a written version of "Saw".<br /><br />Oh well, it was good enough. Just not stellar IMO.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I swore that I wouldn't look at reviews until I finished reading the book, but you know how much I love your reviews. You have certainly captured what I am feeling as I am reading this book. It is deceptively innocent looking, yet I am riveted to it. It saddens me, makes me angry, and makes me go through way too many emotions to even mention. I'll check in later when I finish and actually read everyone's comments.<br /><br />Great review!]]></body>

I was trying to avoid spoilers. <br /><br />Nicole, thank you:)<br /><br />Megan, I agree, we do get attached to the characters, but I personally prefer a realistic ending to a sugar-coated one, even if it hurts.<br /><br />Caty, the <i>Real</i> bit in the end was just so sweet, was it not?

  <body><![CDATA[Wow-your reviews are always so thoughtful, very well said! So agree about the PTSD, I am living it right now. I am also realizing I have a bit of a thing for dark stories, because although it was sad as hell, I did not mind it.<br /><br />So true about Katniss as superwoman, I have always seen this as a story about how a regular girl copes with war vs a regular girl becoming a hero or a romance story. I think I was expecting it to be dark, I was not at all surprised by how it turned out, I was braced for it and was so glad we got some sort of happy ending.<br /><br />Someone mentioned on another forum that this book was almost too real, which I can see, and I think is why people are feeling mixed about it, it is hard to see characters we love suffer so much. A lot of people are talking about how Peeta was 'ruined' which I was confused about, again, I expected him to suffer much more at the Capital's hands.<br /><br />It kind of reminded me of The Book Thief in a very abstract way, have you read that? It is incredible.<br /><br />My thoughts are still so scattered, I am obviously not as together as you are!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I never expected Katniss to become a true political leader. She never wanted to be a part of any of it, but was forced into the slaughter by other people. How much can this girl take? I mean, she's been living in fear for herself and her beloved for years. And how much responsibility for other people's lives can she bear?<br /><br />I have no idea why people say Peeta was ruined? I didn't feel so at all. I was so crushed over what he had had to endure. For me he is the most noble and gentle person in the whole series. <br /><br />I've been meaning to read The Book Thief for years now.<br /><br />And thank you. Writing this review had a therapeutic effect on me:)]]></body>

Thrilling, yes, but at its core, <i>sad</i>. And I liked the ending of Mockingjay, how they'll never be quite in one piece but they're trying, and they have a better world to live in.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[See? that's one of the things I loved the most about this book, it feels real.<br /><br />I live in a country with such a violent history, specially my city. In my experience, when you live so close to so much death and suffering there are two things that usually happens, either you develop some kind of shell around your heart, something to protect you from all the pain around you, or you become so angry, so desperate for things to change that you end up joining the conflict for better or for worst. I’ve seen it happen in real life, that’s one of the main reasons Katniss, Peeta and Gale feel so real, so human.<br /><br />It is such a hard thing to read about, because at the end it’s true. Most people usually take peace for granted. I guess this is harder to understand when you are farther from this kind of reality, as Katniss herself said it, it’s really hard to imagine the Games when all you’ve ever known is the Meadow.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Great review! You said everything I can't ~ still to emotional &amp; teary-eyed to think clearly about this series. I also loved that Katniss never became the sort of heroine we are used to seeing in novels. Rather, she was a 17year old girl ~ confused, depressed, at times selfish.... the beauty of this novel was allowing it to become a dark, gritty tale...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[At first, I was disapointed that there was not a hawt reunion scene between Katniss and... er, the one she ended up with ~ trying to avoid the spoilers :) But the more I thought about it, we already saw these two fall in love. The story was more a test of the relationship, and I think it worked out better this way. <br /><br />Also, I loved that the whole series told a very large &amp; complicated story, all the while focusing on Katniss and her immediate feelings. Although I respect Collins for limiting this to a 3 book series about a teenage girl... it obviously could have grown into a much larger project. It's just amazing to me that Collins is able to create soo many stories &amp; themes &amp; ideas out of one girls tale. <br /><br />I'm actually not suprised that so many people are disapointed, because people love a happy resolution ~ not matter how unrealistic it may be. I agree with you &amp; your statement about Collins gutsiness 100%! :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Who was disappointed with this novel? Was it the crowd that only saw the Peeta/Gale/Katniss triangle? If so, they didn't get the books. It was not about a love triangle. It was about a girl made into a reluctant symbol for freedom, her being groomed for that purpose, and her experiences throughout. Yes, love did get factored in, but it wasn't just a love story.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[@AH: Yeah, I think that's a large part of it; I think a lot of readers thought Katniss'd just kick everyone's ass in this installment and ride off into the sunset with Gale/Peeta and none of them would have lasting emotional scars. Which doesn't quite compute with me, because I think Katniss would be scarred even if only the first book happened. There was nothing about the setting that really allowed for a sweet, romantic story.]]></body>

They'll be dealing with their issues for a lifetime, but they <i>are</i> dealing with them, and they have a better world to live in, and the kids aren't growing up in a totalitarian environment. Now, some of the stuff that happened along the way was depressing, definitely.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[What I was disappointed with in the novel was not that it wasn't a happy, empty ending or that it didn't focus on the romance. I'm glad it didn't and wasn't. I just agree that it was too much in the violence department. (<a href="http://news.shelf-awareness.com/ar/theshelf/2010-08-26/hunger_games_trilogy_questioning_the_violence.htm" rel="nofollow">This article</a> explains pretty well my reaction to the violence.) It got to the point where I wondered when Collins would stop torturing Katniss just to break her. I know Hunger Games and Catching Fire are violent and pigeonhole Katniss, but it finally all got to me in this book.]]></body>

I am just happy this time I agree with the author's vision and try to leave discussions of the book's negatives to the dissatisfied readers. It's too taxing to try to defend it.

She did not look for popularity and status. She was constantly pushed into doing things just to keep those she loved safe. It's completely realistic as far as I'm concerned.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Great review T.<br />You bring up a valid point when you ask, "How many children or adults would be unaffected by such devastation". My answer would be none. But then I ask another question, "How many teenage athletes have spurned a be all end all political rebellion because they helped their team win a game?". My answer to that would also be none. Which leads me to my problem with the series. The realism didn't begin until the final installment when Collins expected me to swallow it. I couldn't because it wasn't the cannon of the previous books. Had it been, I would have loved it as the book was clearly well written, it just seemed to belong to another sereis.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thank you. Katniss is a seventeen year old girl, with real emotions attachments and confusion. She is not a commando or a revolutionary, she has flaws. She is a child! I am so confused when people expected more of her than that. And while I am very happy about how the love triangle panned out it was not really what the story way about.]]></body>

I used to be one of those people who were disappointed, but I knew that I wanted an realistic ending and I got one and after hours of thinking Mockingjay, I understand it now.

  <body><![CDATA[I LOVE what you said!! It's crazy how many people on here are so focused on the love triangle, and they're mad because she didn't pick Gale.... to me that was a side story, it wasn't the main focus - it was nice to see it resolved mind you, but it wasn't everything. And so many people are angry because they see Katniss as weak and easily-manipulated.... the whole point of Mockingjay was that her decisions weren't going to be as easy because she thought she was fighting with the good guys - it's easier to stand against your enemies.<br /><br />It makes me sad. I think we have a strong tendency in our society to misjudge weakness and strength. Not once did I think Katniss was weak. I simply saw her as human. Everyone has a breaking point. And because she unwittingly became a pawn in the very first book, it became important to the tyrants in this story to ensure that she either reached hers or died - once she had served her purpose she needed to become a non-threat. How could she possibly have avoided that? She was a reactor to the events that were controlled by the people pulling the strings. And she was a great protagonist in that she always managed to turn the game to her advantage. But it's ridiculous to expect that she would have wanted to control the game - the people who want that were exactly the kind of people that Katniss could never be.<br /><br />Collins' point was that those who seek power for the sake of having it are generally willing to do it at a heavy cost to those around them. And the brave and the innocent become entangled in their scheming. How could the story have remained honest and ended any other way?<br /><br />And for the record, I think it perfect that she ended with Peeta. The best kind of love is the kind that grows between friends who've shared hard experiences. And the whole point to that ending was to give Katniss the peace she had longed for from the very beginning. The reason it's so easy to love her is that she doesn't love fighting for the sake of it - she's good at it, but she doesn't buy into it. Gale did.<br /><br />I love this series. I'm going to buy the other books. And if I have little girls, I'm going to make sure they get to know Katniss too.]]></body>
