  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian note: an alternate cover for this edition can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21570677-if-i-stay" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just listen, Adam says with a voice that sounds like shrapnel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I open my eyes wide now.&lt;br /&gt;I sit up as much as I can.&lt;br /&gt;And I listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay, he says.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choices. Seventeen-year-old Mia is faced with some tough ones: Stay true to her first love—music—even if it means losing her boyfriend and leaving her family and friends behind?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one February morning Mia goes for a drive with her family, and in an instant, everything changes. Suddenly, all the choices are gone, except one. And it's the only one that matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;If I Stay&lt;/i&gt; is a heartachingly beautiful book about the power of love, the true meaning of family, and the choices we all make.</description>

      <![CDATA[My impression? It was good. Not fantastic, but okay. Decent. Tolerable. But I'm a bit irritated with this book right now, because it is one of those books that has been ridiculously overrated. Yeah, it was sad. But not 'devastating'.

This isn't a bad premise at all, but when the entire book is riding on you being sad that these people are dead, but the people themselves aren't very interesting characters, it isn't likely to turn out very well.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Zoë wrote: "I respect your opinion, but in order to like the book, you must feel how deep it really is and put yourself in her situation"</i><br /><br />It's the duty of the author to write a character that is compelling enough for me to be able to put myself in her situation. If I can't connect to the main character emotionally, then that's the author's fault, not mine.<br /><br />Yes, intellectually, I know that losing your entire family is a very tragic and painful thing, and I would never want it to happen to me. But the simple fact that a tragic event happens doesn't mean that the author handles it well, or that the mere inclusion of that event makes it 'deep'. I can feel sorry for the main character in the distant sense that I wouldn't want this to happen to anybody, but the book didn't make me care about her enough for it to really matter.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Chase wrote: "Kind of with you, but I don't think books should be rated by how sad it is."</i><br /><br />As a general rule, no, but the the intention of this book WAS to be sad, to get the reader to sympathize with the main character and feel the loss the way she did. It failed to do that for me. Of course just because a book is sad doesn't mean it's necessarily well-written or good at all, but when a scene or an entire novel is trying desperately to <i> make you cry </i>, and it <i> can't </i> , that's a problem.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Samantha wrote: "Seriously?!? What do you constitute as devastating then??? The girl lost her entire family... I thought it was an amazing look at how fragile life is, and love... Foreman wove an intricate tal..."</i><br /><br />I already addressed this issue higher up. Since you apparently don't care enough to actually read through the comments and see that your point has already been brought up, I'm just going to repeat my earlier answer. <br /><br />"Yes, intellectually, I know that losing your entire family is a very tragic and painful thing, and I would never want it to happen to me. But the simple fact that a tragic event happens doesn't mean that the author handles it well, or that the mere inclusion of that event makes it 'deep'. I can feel sorry for the main character in the distant sense that I wouldn't want this to happen to anybody, but the book didn't make me care about her enough for it to really matter. "<br /><br />Many books attempt to talk about how 'fragile' life is- death is a common topic in literature. But not every book that talks about death handles it well. I know this won't be a popular opinion, but I disliked John Green's book about cancer for the same reason- the idea of a teenager dying of cancer is sad, but his characters never felt like real people to me. Gus struck me like an idealized version of a boyfriend character who existed to further Hazel's plotline, and the dialogue was a disaster from beginning to end. Yes, kids with cancer is sad. But the way it was written was not enough to make me care. <br /><br />I know people who lived with cancer. I knew people who have died of cancer. The reality of it is sad. But throwing a character with cancer at me and expecting me to cry is like telling me I should be just as affected by the fact that a stranger died of breast cancer last week as I was when my friend's mother, who I'd known for six years, did. Write people who matter. Write people I would be sad to lose. Don't rattle off tragic events like a newspaper headline and get angry when I don't start sobbing.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Samantha wrote: "You are entitled to your opinion, but please don't attempt to tell me what I do or don't care about..."</i><br /><br />Oh, stop being a child. You clearly didn't take the few seconds it would have required to scroll through the comments and see that I've already addressed your specific complaint, and that you weren't likely to get any more out of me by asking the same question all over again. Not to mention that ignoring everything I said and leaving some meaningless comment about "don't tell me what to do!!1!1" so that you can feel like you had the last word is just rude.<br /><br />Everybody's entitled to their opinion. If you loved this book, thought it was sweet and heartfelt etc. etc., that's 100% cool. But you ain't entitled to a bad attitude, and if you were just looking to vent and weren't actually interested in having a discussion about books/how well different works handle death, then sorry, you commented in the wrong place.<br /><br />If there's anyone out there who <i> is </i> interested, a lot of Anne Tyler's book talk about loss in various ways, and I think she's a great writer. The Accidental Tourist has a character recovering from the sudden death of his son and a subsequent separation from his wife, and it's much more sorrowful and ultimately hopeful than anything in If I Stay.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Dear friend, you contacted me. This is my review. This isn't like Facebook, where we shout status updates into the void. When you comment on a person's review, you are essentially saying it to them- ergo, you have no right to demand that I stop replying to you. If anyone's, that right is mine.<br /><br />I fail to see how my opinion is ignorant (perhaps you only say that because it isn't yours?), neither do I see how taking a few minutes to reply to some rather aggressive comments reflects on me somehow. You, dear friend, are rude. I'm sorry if that offends you, but it's a fact. You asked an uneccesarry question, you responded childishly, and now you demand that I leave you alone, as if I've been attacking you rather than just replying to statements you made on <i> my </i> page, as honestly and matter-of-factly as I can.<br /><br />You love this book? Okay, fine. That doesn't mean anything to me. I don't think that makes you a bad person, or that you're dumb, or some other crap- we all like different things, and that's fine. But your attitude sucks, friend. And so, let me ask; please do not contact me again. I don't like you. You're rude and melodramatic and this could have easily been a painless discussion.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[What made me mad was the way the book abruptly ended in my opinion. I thought it was a good book and I honestly couldn't put it down but I expected more from the ending than what it was. I ordered the next book, "Where She Went" but I don't have too many high hopes for it!]]></body>

My point is that I was unable to relate to Mia and her family to the extent that was needed for me to feel as sad about the events as I was supposed to. Read my above comments, I've explained why "just put yourself in her shoes" is a silly excuse, because it assumes that it is all the reader's job to relate to any character they are presented with who has bad things happen to them, rather than the author's job to create characters worth loving and sympathizing with.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I just wanted to share my opinion with you and I didn't have time to read your other comments. I guess it must be different for me because any character that I read, I can easily slip into their shoes and feel what they feel. Maybe that's why the book had more power for me.]]></body>
