  <description>The classic tale of the devastating consequences of playing God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliant, driven Victor Frankenstein has at last realized his greatest ambition. The scientist has succeeded in creating intelligent life. But when his creature first stirs, Frankenstein realizes he has made a monster. And, abandoned by its maker and shunned by everyone who sees it, the Doctor's creation sets out to destroy him and all that he holds dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN remains one of the greatest horror stories ever written, a book that chillingly captures the unforeseen terror of playing God. And the heart-stopping fear of being pursued by a powerful, relentless killer.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Great review, Alejandro! A lot of people who like Frankenstein movies end up not enjoying the book. I liked it, but I think my expectations were different. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, however, I thought was a mind-numbingly boring book that was a total waste of time.<br /><br />It's hard to get into these old classic horrors - because what was shocking and interesting at the time they were written is boring and mundane nowadays.<br /><br />Again, great review! And I agree with you that authors should just admit where they got their inspiration! There's no shame in it.]]></body>

Yes, I agree that sometimes some books due the era when it was written can't impact in the expected way to the readers. That's sad, since I think that a good story should impact the same way not matter whenver is read. No, I haven't read "Dracula", I opted to read before "Carmilla" and it was an effect similar to this "Frankenstein", but hey! I still am planning to read "Dracula" :) I can't promise how much I'd like it, but I am willing to try it ;) I just need to fit it in my messy TBR list ;)]]></body>

Thank you so much for your appraisals :) Oh, yes, I think that nobody with common sense decides to read some book with the anticipation that he/she will hate the book, it could be just dumb. In my case, as I explained I didn't hate it, just found it tedious, and it's maybe because it's one of the pioneers in the field of horror. I am sure that if the book would be more shocking due the publication era, maybe it wouldn't never find someboyd willing to publish it. I am truly glad of finally read it, and I think that's the important. The factor that I didn't enjoy that much, well, it's just something out of our control.]]></body>

Yes, as I commented before with other fellow readers, two readers never read the same book, for one will be just amazing, and to other will be "waste of time" as you put it. It's nobody's fault. One can't control the emotions provoked by a book to each of us. At least, while I didn't enjoy the novel as I'd expected, I would never qualified it as "waste of time", I am glad of finally read the original novel of a story which impacted so much in our popular culture. If I didn't really like it? Well, it's out of my own control. I just expressed my honest impression about the novel. Nor intending to discourage any future potential reader of the book. Each of us should decide for ourselves which novels we want to read, we appreciate recommendations, but at the end, it's our own final decision what defines if we want to read any book and the following reading experience will be out of our control.]]></body>

Great review as always Alejandro! :)"</i><br /><br />That's a fact! :) In her introduction to the book, written by herself, she actually mentioned Darwin indicating that she had read his work as an influence. (I don't know why she never admitted the influences of other clearer sources).<br /><br />Actually, her introduction was written so engaging, that I was sure at that point that I will have the thrill of my life reading the actual novel. Sadly, it wasn't the case but I am glad of finally read it.<br /><br />Thank you so much for your very kind appraisals!]]></body>

After all, Origin of Species wasn't published until 1859, over 30 years after Frankenstein was published. Did she have access to Darwin's unpublished material, or hear him speak, or what?

  <body><![CDATA[Helle and Otherwyrld: Both of you are right on your observation, Charles Darwin started publishing scientific papers until the 1830s and "On the Origin of Species" was not published until 1859. My comment was in reference to Dr. Erasmus Darwin (I apologize for not being specific) which I recently read on the book titled "Darwin's Ghosts" by Rebecca Stott:<br /><br />"Erasmus Darwin had a sophisticated understanding of how species had evolved from a single-celled aquatic ancestor, and how both rocks and species were the result of millions of years of adaptation.....but he did not come to understand evolutionary processes through a detailed story of natural history" <br /><br />Later on Percy Shelley telling Mary Shelley a discovery of Dr. Darwin in which "how in a paste of flour and water you can make tiny organisms increase in number and size, even without air, and they will come back to life when dried out. That is how life began he tells her. Not with a garden in Eden, but with tiny organisms in a pond" <br /><br />The book also mentions the dream and about the 1831 edition of Frankestein in which Mary first talks about the experiments of Dr. Darwin which obviously enormously influenced her as well as his grandson Charles Darwin. I believe she refers to him (Erasmus) only as Dr. Darwin but Im unsure about that. <br /><br />I hope this clarifies the comments made by Alejandro or myself regarding the influence of Darwin on Mary Shelley. :)]]></body>

It's very likely that the regular pacing of books at that time was normally slow. Still, while newer ones, I have read slow novels which I enjoyed so much since the narrative and/or the narrator's voice was engaging, but again you have a valid point about thinking about the style of the books at that moment.<br /><br />Thanks a lot for your input :)]]></body>

Oh, never two people read the same book, so maybe you would love it again, but also, never you can read the same book twice, so maybe your second reading would be different, but maybe not worse, but even better. Who knows?<br /><br />It's likely that if I read the book in 5 years I would see it different ;)<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />Sorry for replying until now.
