  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[NOOOOOO!!!! Omigosh noooo! I will be soooooo disappointed if it turns out to be Gale/Madge. I mean, those are who two best friends and she would love to see them happy, but Katniss would be like the third wheel or whatever. Ugh, Gale is so hot! He has to be with Katniss. But then there's Peeta, he's sooooo sweet and loving, but honestly, he deserves sooo much better than katniss. Like Haymitch said, "You could live a thousand lifetimes and still not deserve that boy, you know?" well he said something like that. <br />Ugh, I love both Peeta and Gale, I hope Suzanne makes her choice all dramatic, not toooo dramatic that it's sappy, but not like "Oh, I've been with Gale my whole life Peeta, I think I want to give someone else a chance" Yeah if that was how it turned out to be I would throw the book down in disgust (not the her picking Peeta part, I have no problem with that, just the way she decided) then, pick it up say my appologies and finish reading. I don't know how I could ever even put Mockingjay down anyways.<br /><br />Hey! I told you about the Peeta and pita bread and him being the bakers son bit! Haha it doesn't take a genius to figure that out but still!!!!<br /><br />At least when I finished reading THG and CF, I had someone to talk to about it, but youuuuuuuuuuu wanted to talk about other stuff. Meaniehead (just playing)<br /><br />8.24.10 is KILLING me! I can hardly wait. I mean every book I read THG envades it. Like in The City of Bones, Clary's hair is bright red, like Foxface's. If Alec's eyes were grey not blue, he would remind me sooo much of Gale (except for the homo part). And Isabelle's long black hair, I was like omigosh dude! Just like Katniss's hair!<br /><br />I. Can't. Wait. Until. Mockingjay<br /><br />Lylas, Baine<br /> Hannah]]></body>

Dude that book was sooooooooooooooo good!!!!!<br /><br />I haven't read the ashes one yet but at the en I was like nooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!! Jace can't be clarys brother!!!! I mean they were so perfect for each other and it turn out they are siblings. Ugh I hope clary doesn't end up with Simon I don't like that kid too much. Oh yeah and I hope her mom wakes up and they get the cup back from her father(hahaha yeah I thought of that as an afterthought, love is so much more important than the fate of the shadowhunter world). <br /><br />Blah I NEED to read city of ashes my cheap parents want to wait until the library has it. That means no in their language becase the library never has any good books. They get so aggrivating at times]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[NO! Madge doesnt like Gale. Madge just brought the painkillers for Gale because Katniss(('s) dont know what to do there either) mum and Madge's(that's easier) mum were friends or something. She explained it away... it's fine, it's fine.<br /><br />...pretty sure Gale is going to die though. But anyway, a possibility people are overlooking is that none of them die? My guess is Haymitch. He's so tortured as is and i think he'll protect/save Katniss and Peeta. Random thought, maybe Finnick will end up with Madge. Or he'll die! Or both! Yes definately both. Glad i worked that out.<br /><br />Everything i've said has been one big contradiction so just one more i promise. <br /><br />Whatever happens Katniss is for sure going to have a kid (that sounded abit sexist) because no more Hunger Games! Maybe she wont know who's it is until it grows up killing turkeys or baking cookies. Or god forbid... swimming.<br /><br /><br />59 days till we find out for ourselves.<br /><br />PS. Hannah, how do you not like Simon, he's funny as. Kinda nerdy to the point of annoying but who doesnt love sarcasm!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I never read the Twilight series so i dont know how far off the movies are, all i know is that if Kristen Stewart made her way into the Mortal Instruments or Hunger Games movies... I WOULD DIE! Seriously she has one facial expression. Find any two sillshots from any of the twilight movies and try and guess what she's thinking. It is always the same!<br /><br />Anyway they will have to handle the Hunger Games movies really carefully, you know, because of all the killing. It will be aimed at teens but you would think it has to be MA15+.<br /><br />Zac Efron doesnt really seem big enough to be Peeta so he would have to work out alot and dye his hair blonde.<br /><br /><br />52 days...]]></body>

So she thinks this is how they'll ruin it! <br />I had the weirdest dream last night about The Shiver movie! It was like my worst nightmare. All I remember is seeing Robert Pattinson in those yellow contacts with black hair. I felt like barfing when I woke up!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Umm first things first, Gale and Madge will NOT end up together! No way, no how. Not going to happen. I went over this didn't I?<br /><br />Second, Haymitch is FOR SURE going to die in some big self sacrifice to save Katniss.<br /><br />Anyway Katniss will choose... Gale. If it is going to be anyone it's Gale. So i'm guessing Peeta will die or fight with Finnick over Madge. Which sucks because i like Peeta better than Gale since Gale never really did anything or made a move until Peeta and Katniss were already fake(not-so-fake) together. For a dreamy guy he's a bit of a wuss in the romance department. Whereas Peeta is actually in love with Katniss and is alot more selfless.<br />“You could live a thousand lifetimes and not deserve him.” <br /><br /><br />Whatever happens I cant wait for Mockingjay. I mean i actually cant wait! It's so far away!!!<br /><br />48 days...]]></body>

(...alwayyyssss!...)<br />you have NO idea how much i wish that werent the case, but it is. im like, psychic. or observent. but psychic sounds cooler<br /><br />if anyone were to make me eat my words though, itd be collins<br /><br />.... wait a sec. what would peeta do without katniss? she may not deserve him, but seriously! if she chose peeta (i mean when), gale would go on. he had a life.<br /><br />whatever. i dont even want peeta to win, but thats probably cuz hes is. if gale were 'winning' id probably be for peeta.<br /><br />and UGH! 48 days???<br />wasnt it just, like, 51 days a week ago?<br />grrr]]></body>

When you wrote something about characters being hot in books, I was like "Holy Crap! FINALLY! I'm not so weird after all!!"<br />lol, I think Finnick is kinda hot too.. <br />and Gale, OMG! I think Gale is hot. <br />Woah..<br />that seemed kinda lame. <br />And when I read a book I imagine the way they look. Then, I decide if they're hot or not. :D]]></body>

Easy $5<br /><br />I get what your saying about the best friend and the other guy thing. But Peeta is more filling the best friend role because he's all devoted and caring and all that nice stuff. Plus she could have him if she wanted him but she doesnt, i think she just feels like she owes him her life... twice. Even though Gale is her bestfriend, he's is the unnatainable(?) one who Katniss cant be with even though she's in love with him. That makes sense, yes?<br /><br />I think your psychicness is failing :P <br /><br />So get ready to eat your words because i have NEVER read a book where the girl chooses the devoted nice guy over the brooding, complicated, "i cant express my feelings because of my deep vulnerability" guy. I would be SHOCKED if she chose Peeta precisely because he doesnt have anything else. She cant make the easy choice! Thats like so... i dont know but she wont do that.<br /><br />This waiting thing is brutal. Its sending me totally insane!!<br /><br />46 days...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[one thing that i noticed about the hunger games books is that the characters arent described in as much detail as other books; i mean, like Katniss isnt checking them out all the time. <br /><br />but thing is, collins is such a damn good writer that i didnt notice that til now. and theres enough of an (awesome) actual storyline/plot that she doesnt need to fill up space with a pointless love story, like, just to fill up pages like some authors do so you don't notice theres no plot (even though theres still some "romance" in there). Katniss isnt a hormone-driven teenager. Shes mature. Shes the provider at her house (like gale, thats why theyd be good together), so shes got more to worry about than guys. <br />thats another reason i love her character.<br />i just wish i could picture the guys better.<br />lol.]]></body>

I went over this didn't I?<br /><br />Second, Haymitch is FOR SURE going to d..."</i><br /><br />Gale is definately the 'witty guy friend' and Peetas definately the sweet 'interest', but (as usual) Gale liked her, she was oblivious, Peeta comes along, he likes her, she likes him, then Gales feelings come out, she realizes she likes him too; but she cant choose -she wont hurt anyone, its not in her nature- and since she has bigger things to worry about, like leading a rebellion, shes not gunna choose early on. i think something big is gunna have to happen for her to realize who she likes best. <br /><br />Besides that, you have to think about whats going through Collins head and what would keep the story going. I didnt think Katniss would choose Peeta over gale b/c Gale has a life, i mean what would Collins do with that story? Gale and Katniss both very busy leading a rebellion together and taking care of their families and everyone they care about and tons of other things while Peeta just sits around mopey? i mean, im sure he would help, but Peetas whole story would be over without Katniss. <br /><br />What do we know about Peetas life 'before'? pretty boring. regular life, minor parental issues, but besides that a very regular, boring life.<br />Gale? his father died, leaving him with 4 (?) siblings and a mom to take care of. he broke the law on a daily basis. Maybe not ideal, but he had a purpose- he still does. his family is the most important thing to him.<br /><br />So what would Collins do with that story? <br /><br />i also think itd be too hard for Katniss to choose, but she needs to end up choosing Peeta so the story can keep going, and collins wouldnt do that to her fans- i mean just letting Katniss say out of nowhere "okay Peeta! i want you!"- so she has to have a legit reason to choose Peeta, so Gales gunna die in the middle of the book i think. im not saying Collins is taking the easy way out, though.<br /><br />...<br />WAIT A MINUTE! i just thought of something...<br />i still like above theory better, but...<br />Katniss could choose Gale without Peetas story coming to a halt if... (lol, more elipses...)<br /><br /><br />well its actually a pretty logical conclusion to come to now that i think about it... im gunna have to update my review...<br /><br />...after they kill Snow or whatever, Peeta becomes the prez! :O ...yeahhhhh<br /><br />ACTUALLY if Katniss ends up choosing Peeta and Gale doesnt die (just dont know what her reasons are), i think Gale would be prez instead of having a dramatic death. And since one of our favorite characters didnt die, thered have to be more deaths to balance it out... haymitch, finnick, madge,.... etc.<br />Actually, this is more probable than Gale dying. Like i said, he had a life. He had a family that was utterly dependent on him to live, Collins couldnt just let his entire familiy die. that would be horrible.<br /><br />Well before anything can happen, Katniss and friends have to go to district 13 and go rescue Peeta and the others<br />...<br /><br /><br />woahhhhh this is lonnnnng!<br />lol.]]></body>

She cares about him because he's saved her like 100 times but i think, especially in the first book Peeta was the one who loved Katniss and she was totally oblivious to it and kept thinking about Gale and what he would think. She thought everything was just for the camaras. I think in a perfect world without hunger games and starving children Katniss would be with Gale because she loves Peeta but is IN LOVE with Gale.<br /><br />Thats just how i saw S.C. set it up. Peeta is the nice guy who deserves her and Gale is the one she really wants. Though at the start of Mockingjay her focus will be on Peeta because she feels super guilty about putting him in danger... AGAIN.<br /><br />and yeah, Marissa if the 3 main characters survive then there will be some serious crying moments in this one. Like i reckon Prim or Mrs Everdeen will die :(<br /><br />45 days...<br /><br />aww crap 45 days! Thats like foreverrr!!!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Maybe they wont rescue Peeta right at the start?<br />It cant be easy to just waltz into the Capitol and break him out. I think that will be his story for most of the book. He'll be captive and they'll have to try and save him while bring down the Prez.<br /><br />Katniss obviously isnt going to choose Peeta or Gale on page 3. It'll be at the end when Peeta doesnt need a story anymore. <br /><br />Im still not sure that one of them isnt going to die so its probably not going to matter anyway.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Dang Baine, congrats, you got like a million comments. Took me bout an hour to get through reading all of 'em.<br /><br />Ok so i got really bored one day and I looked up the latin or romanian or something meaning of the name 'Gale'. It said a big gust of wind<br /><br />So far in the books, Gale hasn't really done that much. But he HAS to live up to up his name, so I think Gale is going to have a much, much, much, much bigger role in Mockingjay then in THG and CF.<br /><br />I mean not that he gets to say more and show up in there more, but that he does something big. And by big I mean sneak into the Capitol, rescue Peeta (while everyone else is still wondering how the heck to rescue him without getting caught), shoot Snow, and then get caught, sacrifice himself so Peeta can escape and go to District 13 and the capitol will kill Gale, or elect a new prezzz and send him into the 76th Hunger Games (if they still have them)<br /><br />Ohmygosh. I just now thought of all that stuff. Like on the top of my head...but wouldn't that be completely amazing if that did happen. I mean it would be like whoah for Katniss when she finds out.<br /><br />It about 40 days now until we actually find out. Is it just me or is anybody else scared for the release?<br /><br />I know I am. I want it to come out, but then again I don't because all this theorizing (I have no clue how to spell that) and stuff that we're all doing will come to a halt.<br /><br />I hope Collins doesn't let Katniss have a baby. In every book I read, the main character having a kid ruins the whole book. (Breaking Dawn, The Lake House (I really can't remember what it was called, but it was by James Patterson), etc) I will seriously throw a tantrum if she has a baby. I mean that would just ruin the entire series. Katniss is 17 FOR HEAVENS SAKE, she is not having little Gale's or Peeta's or even Haymitch's running around. It would just be nasty, she 17!!!<br /><br />Wow. Mockingjay is going to be amazing. No question. I love the Hunger Games Triliogy and I am also dreading the end of it.<br /><br />Hope you have fun at camp Baine!!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Oh yeah, and someone is going to die. No question. I am almost 100% sure about that<br /><br />In every ending to a book series, somebody dies (Uglies-Zane, City of Bones-Hodge, Johnathan, Valentine, Max, shoot even Jace dies, Ugh, dang it, crap, blah, I had a total brain screw up and I forgot every other book I have ever read except THG and I can't give any more examples, ugh). It's not exciting if someone doesn't die.<br /><br /><br />I mean if everbody lives then it would be a happy ending, but there are no happy endings in war. I mean come ON! The districts are in full scale REBELLION!! Somebody, if not somebodiessssss, are going to die. A horrible gruesome death, like Rue.\\<br /><br />Come on people this is the HUNGER GAMES!! Katniss lives in a world where the government thinks it is fun to watch CHILDREN fight to the death for their own entertainment. Suzanne Collins created this world, and in both of the prequels someone big died (yes important people died in Catching Fire, I know ya'll probally didn't cry over Mags death, but she was important, and Wiress, and Darius is as good as dead because he is an Avox) and what would it be if in the exciting thriller ending the series was devoid of all death? I'll tell ya, B.O.R.I.N.G<br /><br />okay maybeMockingjay wouldn't be boring at all, but it would be a major disappointment to me. And I'm sure ya'll would feel disappointed in the book too if nobody dies<br /><br />On August 23, I'm seriously staying up until midnight counting down to the release of MockingJay. Like no lie]]></body>
