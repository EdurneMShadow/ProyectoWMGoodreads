  <description>Will Grayson meets Will Grayson. One cold night, in a most unlikely corner of Chicago, two strangers are about to cross paths. From that moment on, their world will collide and lives intertwine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not that far from Evanston to Naperville, but Chicago suburbanites Will Grayson and Will Grayson might as well live on different planets. When fate delivers them both to the same surprising crossroads, the Will Graysons find their lives overlapping and hurtling in new and unexpected directions. With a push from friends new and old - including the massive, and massively fabulous, Tiny Cooper, offensive lineman and musical theater auteur extraordinaire - Will and Will begin building toward respective romantic turns-of-heart and the epic production of history's most awesome high school musical.</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />This book is one that I'm having a hard time rating. It's nothing to do with the fact that the book is written by two authors and I would split up the writing or anything like that. I found that their writing blended well together, and although I found one Will more fun to read about than another...]]>

Glee is so popular and like I said I love Glee, but I only love actually seeing the performance and hearing the music. In a book just reading about it just didn't have the same effect.]]></body>

Others have really liked it I think. I feel like JG got a ton of new fans with The Fault In Our Stars, and a big percent of them will be disappointed with his older stuff. Just my opinion though.]]></body>

This thing with his older books is a complaint that I have seen many times, but sometimes other people aren't bothered by it at all so maybe you will be able to enjoy his other books more than I did. :-)]]></body>

I feel bad that I didn't have a seriously emotional reaction to TFIOS. Don't get me wrong I loved the book. I loved Hazel and Gus, and their romance was the sweetest thing ever, but it was like idk I didn't really cry or anything. I feel like a douchebag :-/]]></body>

I'm reconsidering even going to 2 stars now, but I just loved their writing style so much. If only the plot had ANYTHING in it lol]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I definitely agree with you about this being better than An Abundance of Katherines- I hated that book with a passion. There wasn't really a character in this book that I liked, tbh. Maybe Will 2's mom, and Will 1's dad, but that's abut it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I can really agree with you on the predictably on this book. I knew from the start that Will was going to get the girl the boy always gets the girl in every book but you have to agree Green did sort of made It seem more realistic. <br /><br />Jane Of course did have a still involved ex which was also predictable but Will's efforts were like no other I've ever seen. Not only did he have that song play for her but he also allowed her to think her Ex did it. At that point I sort of thought it was over but in the end I knew all of Will's efforts would come to light. The scenario itself is a common cliché but you have to give green his credit for the tiny spins he put on it.<br /><br />I personally thought that will and Tiny's relationship was very unpredictable. They are TOTAL opposites. I really think they only got together was because will was in such a weak state after finding out about Isaac. Honestly I thought there little kiss would go know where but I'm glad it did their relationship played A key role in little will's development.<br /><br />Another thing that was a shocker to me was Isaac. It crushed my soul when I found out he was fake. Am I the only one who thinks will kinda sorta over reacted ? Its not like Maura did it out of spite she just wanted Will to open up to her. Scratch what I said I just got the feelings I felt when I read it all over again that was crazy. I'm so glad little will had Tiny to overcome that heartbreak. <br /><br />All in all this was a wonderful book ! I love the concept of not only switching point of views but switching Authors ?!! Genius I loved every word of it.<br /><br />Great Review !]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I completely agree. I've always favored david Leviathan's writing more, and in this book I particularly felt it. Also maybe because I really felt a lot of empathy and understanding for the gay Will Grayson's struggle with depression, but all the other characters seemed much less complex and tiresome.]]></body>
