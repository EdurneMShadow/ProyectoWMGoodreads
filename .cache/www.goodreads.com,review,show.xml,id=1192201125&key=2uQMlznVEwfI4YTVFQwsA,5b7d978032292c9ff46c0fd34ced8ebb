  <description>With precisely 35 canvases to his credit, the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer represents one of the great enigmas of 17th-century art. The meager facts of his biography have been gleaned from a handful of legal documents. Yet Vermeer's extraordinary paintings of domestic life, with their subtle play of light and texture, have come to define the Dutch golden age. His portrait of the anonymous Girl with a Pearl Earring has exerted a particular fascination for centuries - and it is this magnetic painting that lies at the heart of Tracy Chevalier's second novel of the same title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Girl with a Pearl Earring&lt;/i&gt; centers on Vermeer's prosperous Delft household during the 1660s. When Griet, the novel's quietly perceptive heroine, is hired as a servant, turmoil follows. First, the 16-year-old narrator becomes increasingly intimate with her master. Then Vermeer employs her as his assistant--and ultimately has Griet sit for him as a model.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Your usual excellent review, as expected. I read the book and liked it. Then I saw the movie, and loved it too. One of the most wonderful things about the movie, other than Colin Firth (yes, Johansson was good too, but not as pretty as Colin) was the way the cinematographer used the light, as though he were imitating Vermeer's use of that quality. I happened to visit the National Museum of Art in D.C. a few years ago when they had a Vermeer exhibit. I was amazed because the paintings were so small. Beautiful but small.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I really liked this book because Chevalier managed to recreate the sexual tension between the painter and the young maid and make it palpable, almost as an invisible character that consumes not only Vermeer's in his obsession and artistic frenzy but also the reader. You emulate that feeling with firm hand Jeffrey, almost as if years of looking at the girl's innocent glance and parted lips gave you a taste of Vermeer's malady! ;P<br />Terrific review and magnificent movie adaptation, indeed. Colin Firth is a winner for me.]]></body>

I've got a print of that hanging in my library. <br /><br />I agree that Johansson was well cast for the role. I'm planning to rewatch it this weekend if time allows. I haven't seen it since it first came out. I've been meaning to read this book ever since 2003! *sigh* too many other distractions.]]></body>

If you like tension created by what is not said then you will really enjoy this book. It reminded me of Mary Reilly which is another understated book. I loved the restraint that Chevalier showed with the plot. Thanks Cheryl!]]></body>

Her virtue is only safe if she is extremely lucky. She has no recourse for justice if Van Ruijven does manage to force himself upon her. Even Vermeer is powerless to protect her from men or from his own wife. These desires that men have for her are somewhat baffling because she does not feel the same way when they touch her. She only feels something like desire when she thinks of Vermeer's paintings or when she sees a Vermeer sky. Thanks Dolors! I could probably write another review keying on different things than what I did because despite the small size this book has a lot of moments that are larger than what they may seem.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[An excellent review. I really appreciate those who appreciate art and know how to express their appreciation well. My Bachelor's is in Humanities, and, as a result, I've condemned myself to that little island of people who really, REALLY love a well-composed and executed painting. I get in trouble at museums because I love to get as close as I can so I can see the brush-strokes and layers on a painting. I've had more than one security guard clear their throat in my direction. Anyway, love the review, Jeffrey!]]></body>

My Bachelor's is in Humanities, and, as a result, I've condemned myself to that li..."</i><br /><br />While in college I took an Art Appreciation Class that changed my life. The professor shotgunned so much art at me that still today I can recognize most of the major artists. I also learned what I liked which gave me a basis for discovering more painters I liked. Vermeer absolutely staggered me. I can still remember seeing Matisse's Woman With a Hat in San Francisco and realizing that all the prints of that picture I'd seen did not do the painting justice at all. I didn't know I liked Matisse until I saw his paintings in "the paint". I too am familiar with that guard throat clearing sound. <br /><br />Both of my kids have been forced (I can be persuasive with the whole this class changed my life lecture.) to take an Art overview class in college as one of their electives. I still feel like I have so much to learn because I set aside my love of paintings to pursue literature, but now it is time to begin expanding on my art education. <br /><br />Thanks Forrest! I can see the headline now. "Writer arrested for leaving nose print on Masterpiece". :-)]]></body>

David's hand was so tempting, but I decided that spending my vacation in an Italian police office was not worth it. :-)]]></body>

And then return to this review!<br /><br />Hats off to: your comment about reaching into the painting ... and the paragraph comparing your reading experience to watching a close baseball game. (Or maybe, "thumbs up"; or possibly "hats up and thumbs off"?)]]></body>

I'm probably the only person who would compare a baseball game to reading a book about a Dutch painter. :-)People who don't like baseball aren't REALLY SEEING the game. The psychology of the game eclipses all other sports. The suspended animation of the game until the pitch is thrown adds to the drama. Players have to go from stillness to explosive action in what seems a nanosecond. The tension I felt in this book was similar. That moment when everyone is waiting for something to happen. Thanks Ted! I hope you enjoy the book and the upcoming baseball season. :-)]]></body>

I will be haunted forever by the third base coach halting Alex Gordon at third base in the bottom of the ninth. I believe Gordon would have made it safely home to tie the ballgame. It was the safe call to halt him at third, but how dramatic would that sprint for home have been.]]></body>

I'm more worried about that beautiful Delft ceramic jug. :-) The painting is unsettling though. I mean the casual way he is cupping her breast in ownership is also uncomfortable. The movie is really good. I hope you get a chance to see it. Thanks Mohsin!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Usually, they are easily available, Jeffrey. But there are some which I am unavailable to find. For instance, I have never been able to find TransSiberian (2008) which is an American-German-British co-production. However, it was finally available last week on YouTube, so I was able to watch it. In Brujes (2008) too was unavailable, but I was lucky to find it last month at the flea market where stuff from the UK and several other countries arrives here. It is mostly charity stuff. <br />There are many old films which I can't get here like The Professionals (Burt Lancaster, Lee Marvin), A Man Called Horse (Richard Harris), Borsalino (Jean-Paul Belmondo, Alain Delon) etc., but have seen them on TV or on my laptop. <br />Some classics I bought during my trips to Dubai in 2011 and Istanbul in 2013.]]></body>

And so were Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan (2007) and Taken (2008). When they make sequels, like for the latter film, it is only for making money. <br />I also loved The Banquet (2006), a Chinese wuxia drama film, released on DVD in the US as Legend of the Black Scorpion. House of Flying Daggers (2004) and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (2000) were even better.]]></body>
