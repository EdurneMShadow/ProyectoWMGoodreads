  <description>The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it, To Kill A Mockingbird became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[This would be my one sentence summery: Despite the smart, unbiased lawyers brilliant and logical arguments the racism of the 1930's population won out and the scared, most likely poorly educated African-American took what he saw as the only (and probably was his best) option and got shot trying to make a run for it leaving another bloody mark on black-white relations and teaching a young girl not to be prejudice in the process. Kind of run-on but that's what I got from it. I guess you see what you want to see.]]></body>

Because that is when we learned about racism in that time period. How is this book racist when it is just portraying racism? The main characters where not racist, it was the rest of the town. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Wow, Alex is right; you totally missed the point of this story...<br /><br />If you know your history then you should know that people at that time would have sent a 'negro' to prison almost without a trial.<br /><br />The purpose of Atticus was to show a contrast of the same people (whites) with different beliefs. He was there to defend a black man instead of being thick headed like some of the other white people.<br /><br />What could the other black people do to defend their kind? Nothing, the white jury would have cared less; Atticus was a white person, and the white jury would have at least thought about a white man's point.<br /><br />This book's purpose (as Helena said) was to show the unfairness of racism during this period of time.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I think the Kill a Marking Bird was a wonderful book. It showed a time in american history when only a few brave men and women stood up to the unjust and tried to speek out for a people at that time that had no voice. I think now the question is are there any left like Atticus today?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I see that you read this book in 1996. Let me ask.... was that when you were in high school? From my experience as an English teacher, most teens don't "get" TKAM. I am sorry to tell you this, but you totally didn't get it. In fact, you COMPLETELY missed the point. Try reading it again with a little more life experience under your belt. Maybe that will make a difference... if not, sorry, you are really missing out!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I read TKMB in high school but don't remember much about it. I do remember not liking it, mainly because the children were the stereotyped innocent kind whose behavior hardly reflects the behavior of actual children. I don't recall thinking the book was racist, although if your summary of the plot is accurate, I can see why you and others would think that it is. I plan to read TKMB again in the near future to see if my perspective has changed, and when I do I'll keep your review in mind. Thanks for posting it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[It seems to me like you're willingly deluding yourself to think this way for the sake of saying something sensational. Yes, Tom Robinson escaped from jail and got himself killed. Why? Because he decided to take his life into his own hands! Some might say that's a pretty understandable thing to do, considering his bleak future and the biased justice system of the time.<br /><br />Are you quite sure that you don't think To Kill a Mockingbird portrays the "damn darkie" as "so stupid" because you are projecting your own racist views onto the plot?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Like so many here have pointed out, you're making the mistake of reading it with a 21st century perspective. You're missing the basic difference between a book about racism and a racist book. <br /><br />The fact is that in the 1930s, in Alabama, it very much was a case of riding to the defense of Tom Robinson. Look at what happened to Atticus and his family because of that decision. Atticus was pretty well respected about town and as soon as he decided to help Tom, he and his children were outcast (or worse) and even Tom was forced to accept that there was no hope for him.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[You dislike the racism in the book so much that you use racist words in your review? That certainly makes sense. I must echo those who say you've missed the point of the book. And you specifically miss the point of Tom's death. Do you really think Atticus was going to be able to help him? Atticus was in denial. And I personally am suspicious of the account of Tom's death. I do think Harper Lee intended the story of his death to be the truth, but if this happened in real life I would suspect that the guards forced him to run just so they could shoot him in the back.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever read. You've completely missed the point of the novel. Clearly you were looking for a novel where the black man saves himself without any help from white people. Unfortunately for you, this book is historically accurate. Also, Tom Robinson doesn't 'go and get himself killed' as you've said. There was no chance he could have won the appeal so he decided to take a chance and possibly die on his own terms rather than being killed for a crime he didn't commit. Urgh, you're so ignorant.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[You did totally miss the point of this novel. Yes, there are racist comments and stereotypes, but the book takes place in the1930's. Racism was the rabid dog we see later in the novel: have you heard of symbolism? This novel is the greatest American novel of the 20th century... To say it's a racist novel is to miss Harper lee's entire point. Take a class.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Oh dear God. I read this for the first time in ninth grade, when I thought books like To Kill a Mockingbird were difficult to read, and even I got the point of it. This book was written during the 60's when racism was alive and thriving. This book portrays a white man who is willing to help a black man. A white man who is willing to give up his good reputation for a poor, crippled black man. <br /><br />And what's really funny to me is that you called Tom Robinson a "damn darkie," and you're calling someone else racist. Way to go.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Rishi, I think the criticism would be fit for a novel set in the South in 2011. However, it was set during a time when there would not have even been, for example, black lawyers. Having a white man defend a black man was the only possible situation. As the others said, it's not about the inherent stupidity of a black man. It is about how racism is an oppressive, unjust force in society.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I know that lots have people have said that you missed the point of this book, but I think that you are simply looking at it from the wrong perspective. You are still looking at the black and the white. Try to look at the people for the characteristics they have. Atticus and Boo could have been black and Tom Robinson white. I think that the bigger picture was seen more after the trial when Atticus told Jem not to worry about Bob Ewell's death threat. "stand in Bob Ewell's shoes for a minute." Atticus says. The book causes or should have you to look at the way that people were/are treated in everyday society. We need to put ourselves in theirshoes and see that its not about the color.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I think it would be fair to criticize some of the limitations of To Kill a Mockingbird and some of its faults. But I don't think you do a good job here with that. For one thing, your intepretation that Tom is portrayed as a "dumb darkie" who "stupidly" runs and gets shot to escape prison is a very shallow and I would argue inaccurate reading of what happened in the book. If you look at the actual text, when Atticus reveals how Tom died, it says: "They said if he had two good arms he would have made it, he was moving that fast...We had such a good chance [at getting an appeal/getting Tom acquitted], but I couldn't in truth say we had more than a good chance. I guess Tom was tired of white men's chances and preferred to take his own." The book does not portray Tom's choice to try to escape as stupid. He was very close to escaping, and would have if not for his bad arm. Further, though the towns people later call it stupid, this view looks superficial and racist next to the reality Harper Lee shows us here: that Tom recognized how deeply intrenched racism was in the system. He had no reason to believe in a system governed and run by white men who continually have cheated him. So he tried to escape it--and he arguably had more of a chance at that than at winning in court. This decision is seen as logical to Atticus. He sympathizes with Tom's decision. It's not a stupid decision--in fact, being killed instantaneously that way would arguably have been better than him going to the electric chair or even going free only to very likely have been lynched by racists. Notice that he died on his own terms. He didn't die at the mercy of white men, at Atticus' failure. But he was his own agent and tried to escape in his own way. I think this successfully wrenches white saviorism from Atticus--and even the white judicial system: instead, he dies by RESISTING this system.<br /><br />The system is portrayed as a racist, murderous system that is deeply flawed. As Lee states very close to the beginning of the novel, Atticus began to have "a profound distaste for the practice of criminal law" due to the absurdity of two of his clients being hanged simply for NOT pleading guilty. Atticus' hope and faith in the system was already begin to erode before this case. Lee also presents more of a criticism when the characters discuss how women cannot serve in the jury, and in the legal jargon around rape which is sexist and presented as preposterous (Jem notes that a woman must "hollar and fight" to be raped, but only if she is over 18, if she's a minor "she doesn't have to do that.") The legal system itself is shown to privilege white men over people of color and women. This criticism is also highlighted during the scene when Scout and her classmates talk about Hitler in class and her teacher explains that in democracy there is no prejudice and everyone is treated equally, to contrast the US with Nazi Germany. An astute reader can see the irony here. We've just read through a case dripping with prejudice. Lee launches a biting criticism of American society and its hypocrisy. This is just the tip of the ice berg.<br /><br />There's a lot going in this book, but much of it is in the subtext, and you actually have to look at all the different criticisms Lee is launching on religion, society, law, "justice," etc. You could argue Atticus is yet another white savior in a racial novel, and maybe that criticism has merit, but your very shallow read does very little to illuminate what's going on in the book if that's the case. And the fact that Atticus ultimately fails in a system with a deeply entrenched racism, and the fact that many of the "good" white characters say racist things themselves problematizes the simple narrative you're trying to project onto this book. If this was a book about white saviorism, Atticus would win--or at least, another white person would. If ignorance was portrayed as the only (simple) problem behind racism, Atticus would merely have to educate racist white men, who would be cured of their racism when they were cured of their ignorance. And if you're going to argue he's a white savior, especially when he doesn't save anyone, you need to go deeper and actually analyze the book. Otherwise, your criticism has very little weight.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hm, my perspective was something else entirely. Tim ran not because he was 'a stupid Negro', but because he was a man left with no hope. He took matters in his own hands, and though he chose the wrong means to do so, he didn't know any better not because he was black, but because he was a simple uneducated man. That African Americans constituted most of this time's 'uneducated people' was another matter entirely. Atticus was a hero because he stood up for Tim when few else would, and standing before a community rooted deeply in their racist behaviours was truly courageous, because he didn't only face social ostracism, but real, physical violence against him and, worse, his children. He did seem like a modest hero to me, but maybe my view of him is indeed too idealistic?]]></body>
