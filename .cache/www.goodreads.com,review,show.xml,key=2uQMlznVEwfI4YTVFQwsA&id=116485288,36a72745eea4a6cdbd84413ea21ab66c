  <description>The critically acclaimed, bestselling novel from Gayle Forman, author of Where She Went, Just One Day, and Just One Year. &lt;br /&gt;Soon to be a major motion picture, starring Chloe Moretz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the blink of an eye everything changes. Seventeen year-old Mia has no memory of the accident; she can only recall what happened afterwards, watching her own damaged body being taken from the wreck. Little by little she struggles to put together the pieces- to figure out what she has lost, what she has left, and the very difficult choice she must make. Heartwrenchingly beautiful, this will change the way you look at life, love, and family. Now a major motion picture starring Chloe Grace Moretz, Mia's story will stay with you for a long, long time. &lt;br /&gt;" &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Love it, love it, love it. Great review!<br /><br />I get what you're saying about subjective reviews, but sometimes sites like Goodreads drive me nuts. I first stalked GR for a few weeks before finally signing up. And in that time, and after, until I finally found people whose judgement I trusted, I was floating in a sea of unreliable reviews. Imagine if you had no GR friends and were looking to get an opinion on... say, Wings (this is because I am looking for a change from victimising Hush Hush or Fallen, which I seem to have mention in too many posts to count!) andall you got in the first ten pages of reviews were gushing fangirls, and you actually made the mistake of taking them seriously and reading the book? *shudders* At least an objective, balanced review by a professional reviewer means you get the good and the bad, and the freedom to decide, as well as the advised opinion of someone who knows her/his books and authors!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I know what you mean, but once you find some kindred spirits it makes for an amazing experience. What the heck were you doing trusting fangirls, Vinaya? That's not like you! I keep slogging through the pile of reviews until I find some that I can identify with. Usually, the ones that spew love aren't particularly persuasive:-) (says the girl who said that the Fever series was like craic to her and left it at that.)]]></body>

I just went, looked up the funniest most sarcastic reviews there, thought, Soulmate! and added them! :D The Fever series <i>is</i> like craic, so it wasn't a bad review or anything! ;)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Bad reviews are so much more helpful for finding kindred readers than good reviews. When someone looks at a book more critically, that gives me a better idea of whether or not I share the same reading tastes with that person. <br /><br />After all, even the worst book *cough* Twilight *cough* can inspire illogical emotion and adulation from the best of us. (Not <i>me</i> of course! I use "us" metaphorically *blushes*)]]></body>

He's the ultimate anti-Edward :)<br /><br />Glad you liked Hush, Hush :) That inspired a very special hatred!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I think the fangirls who endlessly praise books, often without any good reason, can ruin the rating and review system for the rest of us. I admit that I'm a fangirl for the Fever series but I'm also willing to admit that it has it's faults. I can also recognize that not everyone is going to love it. And above all, I realize that Barrons is <i>not real</i>. Did you know that if you type "I'm having trouble" into Google, one of the autocompete suggestions is "I'm having trouble dealing with the fact that Edward Cullen is a fictional character"!!!!! Really?! Don't these girls know the difference between fantasy and reality? Geez.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[See, that's what I mean! Why would someone who could sing like that go sell themselves out for a crapbucket like Bewitched? Nicole Kidman is doubly blacklisted; not only did she agree to star in this movie, but actually asked Nora Ephron to cast Kristen in Bewitched. I can't stand Will Ferrell anyway, so I don't care what he does, except, of course that I adored Dick York on the original TV series and I want to bitch slap Ferrell for ruining it. *rant over* :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[That was so great!! Totally teared up about your experiences w/Katrina - even though I've heard about it before! You just wrote about it so well. I also agree with what you said about reviews. I mean, what is really even the point of an objective review? Just so we can make a list of the decade's best books, or give the author an award? I was just thinking about this dilemma last night, b/c I finished Heartbreaking Work and then read this ridiculous thrillr from B's kindle. HB was CLEARLY created from much more talent, originality, etc. But I kind of liked the experience of suspense from the stupiid thriller more!! So its almost like we need 2 ratings: how objectively good is it, but then what was the experience of reading it actually like? I can sometimes enjoy a book as kind of a work of art - and certainly appreciate that quality of writing - but most of the time, I would rather just read something entertaining!...but again, at the same time, that doesn't mean I can't recognize the difference between those books and ones that are objectively much better written. And then to take it to an even broader level: we are all, as you eloquently pointed out, human beings, with our own histories. Is there really such a thing as being objective at all??]]></body>

I think a better step would be to find a more effective way to track books in the store and then shelve them across genres. I'm always surprised which fantasy/sci-fi/PNR, etc. books I can find in the general fiction section.

  <body><![CDATA[@Tatiana--it's especially funny when you think about where the books you learn in school would be shelved if they did not have the distinction of being "classics" nowadays. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5107.The_Catcher_in_the_Rye" title="The Catcher in the Rye by J.D.

It's like we can't accept the literary value of any genre fiction until a certain amount of time has passed. Maybe those literary genre books you spoke of will be eventual classics:-)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[But at least seperating by genre gives you a starting point. Everything mashed up together ~ can you imagine Hemingway on the same shelf as LKH? *shudder* I don't even like Hemingway (or LKH!) but they are worlds apart and deserve to be so. <br /><br />Yes, a lot of books are not easily fit into one category or another, but that is why helpful bookstore employees, GR, professional reviews and word of mouth is so important to those of us who like to read. <br /><br />By the way, after years of living together &amp; marriage my hubby &amp; I still get into fights over our library ~ my books are happily arranged by genre (or at least genre that makes sense to me :)) literary, non-fiction is of course segregated into category. And his are <i>all</i> mixed together ~ fiction, genre, non-fiction ugh! Everytime we try to combine books into one massive collection it leads to so much anger because we simply cannot agree on which book goes where, lol]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Agreed. Michael chabon is facsinating because even as he talks about this issue, he also serves as a cool example of someone who is able to Buck the typical categories - he totally writes genre books but b/c he's already been established as literary, they're all just categorized as that.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[But don't you think that, in a way, literary is also a genre? Correct me if I'm wrong ~ but literary fiction focuses on the quality of writing, character development and the overall theme or emotions evoked by the book, right? So, really if that is what you are going for, it's no different than a sci-fi author or romance author sticking to what is expected in their own genre.]]></body>
