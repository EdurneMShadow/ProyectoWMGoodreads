  <description>&lt;b&gt;About three things I was absolutely positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Edward was a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there was a part of him—and I didn't know how dominant that part might be—that thirsted for my blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first book of the Twilight Saga, internationally bestselling author Stephenie Meyer introduces Bella Swan and Edward Cullen, a pair of star-crossed lovers whose forbidden relationship ripens against the backdrop of small-town suspicion and a mysterious coven of vampires. This is a love story with bite.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Thanks for the compliments, ladies!<br /><br />Daisimae, I hope the girl you work with enjoys it. I know I sure did. It was so good, it's hard for me to believe that this was a debut novel for Stephenie Meyer. This lady definitely has talent. Yeah, it's too bad you don't do first person. I was actually thinking of you and all my other GR friends who don't like that while I was reading the book. ]]></body>

She started the book as soon as we got home and couldn't put it down! Somewhere around midnight (and 250 pages into the book) I finally told her to give her eyes a rest. I can't wait to read it myself now.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Collette,<br />Glad I could renew your interest in <i>Twilight</i>. I know what you mean about bad reviews. I had the same thing happen to me with the BDB series. I saw some really bad reviews for <i>Lover Unbound</i>, so I procrastinated reading it for months. Of course, I ended up loving it, and asking myself why I'd waited so long.;)<br /><br />Tammy,<br />I can relate to you daughter. I was sooooo frustrated every time I had to put it down. <br /><br />Hope you both enjoy the book as much as I did.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Twilight will be in the theatres December 12th of this year. I'm pretty sure you can find the trailer for the movie online.<br /><br />We LOVED Batman!!!! I was blown away by Heath Ledger's performance. If I hadn't known in advance that it was Heath playing the part of the Joker, I never would have believed it. (He was one of my daughter's favorite heartthrobs and I loved him in 10 Things I Hate About You.) I keep hearing talk of Oscar nominations. Definitely will be seeing this one again! But be forewarned the movie is a little over two and a half hours long.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Kathrynn,<br />You can find 3 different trailers and a short behind the scenes featurette for the <i>Twilight</i> movie here:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.twilightthemovie.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.twilightthemovie.com/</a><br /><br />The trailers were pretty exciting, but based on what I saw, it seems like they may be trying to spice things up a bit by making the movie a little scarier and more action oriented than the book is. The book is definitely all about the relationship with the action being secondary. I'm still looking forward to watching the movie, but I'll probably be picking it apart for all the differences. I was already seeing some in the trailers. I'm terrible that way.;) It's rare that I read a book I really enjoy and then like the movie as well, but hopefully it will still be good.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Oooooh! Thanks for the link Julie. It will be fun to look up the other trailers with my daughter tonight! (BTW: She just called me at work to ask if I can stop at B&amp;N and pick up the 2nd book in this series. She HAS to have it tonight! LOL!!)<br /><br />Don't worry about comparing books and movies. I do the same nit-picking thing. Oddly enough, I liked the movie versions of The Notebook and PS I Love You better than I did the books. Sometimes the movie script/re-write can be more interesting.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thanks Julie. <br /><br />I do the same thing with books and movies. <br /><br />I have to say, the only book that I recently read and then saw the movie and they were almost identical was 30 Days of Night.<br /><br />I think even the dialogue was the same. ;-) Good movie and good book--lousy ending.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[LOL, Tammy! Yeah, this book has that effect on people. I was just one chapter from the end, when I went rushing out to Sam's Club to see if they still had Book 2 &amp; 3. It turned out they only had #2, but that's good enough for now. I wasn't quite sure what I was in the mood to start last night, and ended up going with a Harlequin instead. I'm starting to regret that decision now. <i>
  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49041.New_Moon__The_Twilight_Saga__Book_2_" title="New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) by Stephenie Meyer" rel="nofollow">New Moon</a>
</i> is sitting here calling to me. Help! I think I'm obsessed.;)<br /><br />When it comes to books that are made into movies, I think I tend to prefer whichever one I experience first. When the book is really great for me though, the movie almost never measures up. I think the only one I can think of so far where I liked the book and movie equally well was <i>The Lion, the Witch &amp; the Wardrobe</i>, but as my husband says, that book was just the perfect length for making into a movie without loosing any of the story or having to modify it to fit everything in. I do admit that the first 2/3 of <i>Twilight</i> moves at a pretty slow pace, which is fine for reading but would probably put movie audiences to sleep.;) I just hope that the beauty and nuance of the relationship doesn't get lost in the added suspense.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I have high hopes for the movie after I watched the trailers last night! My daughter is already half-way thru the second book now (she bought it last night) and she keeps demanding that I read the first book next week on vacation. We are such a funny family - we haven't packed a single swimsuit or planned our wardrobes but by golly! we know exactly which books we are taking on vacation. = )]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[LOL, Tammy! You're actually not so strange.;) I started picking out my vacation reading material long before I picked out any clothes. My daughter did too. I must have taken more than half a dozen books with me and then ended up being so busy, I barely had time to read at all. I was going through serious withdrawal by the time I got home.;) Have fun! I you decide to read the book, I hope you enjoy it!]]></body>

I loved the movie so much I knew I had to read the book. I felt what you described when I watched the movie. I am excited that those elements are in the book.]]></body>

Plus she watches tons of Edward and Bella videos on You Tube and scenes from the movie. I think I will take the first two with me when I go to Ft. Worth for the next few weeks.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA["These two teen protagonists affected more stark honesty in their communication than many adult characters in romance novels, rarely holding anything back from each other. Edward was even forthcoming about who and what he was.." I agree there. These two protagonists have more communication than most real-live adults. That is why so many women love the story, right? That is the attraction of Edward - he TALKS! ]]></body>

I feel the same way about this series and was getting very disappointed and questioning my choice to join this website when i saw the horrible things members have said about the books. Now, i have no regrets to c that there r members here with familiar tastes.<br /><br />U r right about the love Edward and Bella have for each other, the love they have for their families and friends.<br /><br />I'm so mesmerised by Edward, He's so perfect. What I like best about him are his dialogues, his intense, passionate love for Bella conveyed in such beautiful words.<br /><br />Bell, too is an amazing character. Her love, compassion, thoughtfulness, loyalty and so many other aspects make her a character one would love and respect.<br /><br />Thank u again for the great review. I'm here to stay now:-)]]></body>

There certainly are a lot of scathing reviews of this series, but I've met lots of people here who love them too. <br /><br />I totally agree with everything you said about Edward and Bella. They're wonderful characters, and theirs is one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever read.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Lily, I notice that you rated Twilight 4 stars. That seems like rather harsh criticism for such a high rating.<br /><br />In any case, I can understand why some readers aren't enamored of Bella. Even I'll admit that her self-esteem isn't very good. I could relate to her though, because I know lots of people, myself included, who have dealt with self-confidence issues. I also know that Bella isn't exactly the empowered woman that tends to be admired by society nowadays, but being rather old-fashioned myself and not particularly the feminist type, again I could understand her on some level. Sure, I wish that she could have seen in herself what Edward, Jacob and seemingly everyone else around her saw, but the harsh reality is that we are often our own worst critic. <br /><br />As far as her getting married at 18, sure, it's a little young by the current standards of western society, but not outside the realm of normalcy. If you look at other societies or historically, that would be virtually an old maid.:-) As for her getting pregnant, they didn't even know that was possible and they were married, so to me, that's a non-issue.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure what you mean about Bella being peer pressured. If I recall correctly, she seemed to be more stubborn and independent in her thinking, usually going against the grain of what everyone else wanted her to do. I'm also a little baffled by your comment about her getting beaten up by her boyfriend. Edward never laid a hand on her in anger. If anything he was extremely over-protective of her. <br /><br />Anyway, that's why I still liked it, but as I said, I can understand why you or others might not have and you're certainly entitled to your opinion. It's just a case of different strokes of different folks. Just think of it this way: If we all liked the same things the world would be a pretty boring place.:-)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Still one of my faves. My daughter gave it to me after she read it. I really wasn't into Young Adult fiction until after this book. Sure, there is some stuff that could have been cleaned up a bit, but it's still a very good love story and who can't fall in love with Edward after reading it?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I don't agree with your review. The plot and charactars where boring and bland and the romance shallow. Though I respect your review, since I had my own twilight phase, I suggest you read more ya fiction. There are better books like Harry potter, va academy, and chronicles of Vladimir Todd. They are more realistic and interesting plot and charactars wise, and more accurate in the way teens act and think. Also the Cassandra Clare series. Vampires are not twilights watered down versions, but Harry potter doesn't really apply though it is an mazing book. I hope that this opens your eyes to a better idea on ya fiction]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[While I wouldn't necessarily call myself well-read in the genre yet, I have read other YA books, some romance, some not. I agree that the Harry Potter books are wonderful and are among my all-time favorites. Most of the other YA books I've read I've also enjoyed, and I have many more on my TBR list that I'm eager to try. However, it's highly improbable that trying new books will change my mind on the Twilight series, but it will hopefully give me more books to enjoy equally as well. I'm just not the type of person whose opinions and tastes are easily altered. There are books that I enjoyed during my childhood and teen years that I still love as an adult woman, and I know that my teenage self would have loved Twilight every bit as much as I do, having discovered it as an adult.<br /><br />I may not be well-read in the YA genre, but I am very well-read in general with broad tastes, especially in romance, including paranormal. As a writer too, I think that vampires and other mythological creatures can be whatever the author wants them to be. Since they don't actually exist, I'd say there's no real benchmark on what they should or shouldn't be. It's all up to the author's imagination as to what they come up with and the reader's imagination as to what they're able to buy into. In fact, I would go so far as to say this is true in any fiction genre. A big part of that is whether the author is able to make an emotional connection with the reader, and not every reader is going to connect with every author and her books. For me, Twilight happened to hit that emotional sweet spot. I'm sorry that it didn't do that for you, Julia, but I do fully respect your opinion. After all, if we all liked/disliked the same things, the world would be a pretty boring place.:-)<br /><br />I just ran across this quote from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/669810.Jeaniene_Frost" title="Jeaniene Frost" rel="nofollow">Jeaniene Frost</a> which perfectly sums up what I was trying to say, so thought I would add it to my response: "For some, vampires are still firmly in the 'evil, scary' column. However, in recent decades, vampires also run the gamut from evil to morally ambiguous all the way to fangless and vegetarian. I think part of their appeal lies in their versatility. Vampires can be the villain, the hero, and everything in between, all depending on the writer's whim. You'll also never hear me say that anyone is doing vampires 'wrong' because unless a real vampire stands up and sets the record straight, it's anyone's game as a far as defining them in fiction."]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[So, I am not going to bash you opinion or anything, but I can say that I think you are completely and utterly wrong. You say it is romantic? No. Just no. If you think that a 100 year old vampire watching a 17 year old girl sleep is cute or sweet, we have a whole other issue. I was 8 when I read this, and could still see that this was abuse. And to see an adult that does not seem in any way stupid or irrational think this is love is a little weird. Edward also says he would do anything for Bella, but he leaves her while she is emotionally unstable. And seriously, if Isabella Swan, Queen of Mary Sues, counts as a good role model, I don't know what doesn't. She tries to kill herself to HEAR HER BOYFRIENDS VOICE. I get that she misses him in all, but really? I think the whole idea of a human and vampire is awesome, but Stephanie Meyer completely ruined it. I can think of hundreds, thousands of books better than this. The Mortal Instruments. The Hunger Games. Divergent. The Fault in Our Stars. Every other book known to the universe, except its sequels, which are equally horrifying. I like the villains better than Bella and Edward. And Jacob? He falls madly in love with an infant. Like, whoa. Seriously, whoa. If you want your kids to end up like Bella, needy and dependent on sparkling vampires, that's your problem, but you better watch out for her husband. Just think about that. Thank you for reading, Liv.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Liv, you're certainly entitled to your own opinion on these books, and I completely respect that. I just think that you and I see things very differently. <br /><br />To me, Twilight is simply a new take on the classic Beauty and the Beast theme, which is one of my all-time favorite fairy tales. It's a fictional fantasy that might not be very realistic, but that doesn't mean that it can't be entertaining or even fun within the safe confines of a person's own imagination. Not to mention, I can relate to the main characters in a lot of ways. I've been through many experiences in my nearly 45 years of life that have made me very open-minded to many different situations and points of view. I love to ponder about the what-ifs, which is why I enjoy reading and writing fiction so much.<br /><br />The reality is that what is sweet, or romantic, or touching to one person, may not be to someone else. There are things in this story that you obviously see one way, but I see a little differently. Everyone's personality and life's experiences are different, therefore each person who reads a story is going to take away something different from it. That doesn't mean that one person is right, while the other one is wrong. It simply means we're two individuals with unique perspectives.<br /><br />I agree that there are books that are better than Twilight, but there are also many books that aren't as good, IMHO. Twilight may not be the height of great literature, but I don't think anyone can truly deny that it has become a cultural phenomena. Some of the most popular voices in adult paranormal romance, such <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20248.J_R__Ward" title="J.R. Ward" rel="nofollow">J.R. Ward</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/669810.Jeaniene_Frost" title="Jeaniene Frost" rel="nofollow">Jeaniene Frost</a> have defended Stephenie Meyer's work or have even attributed a measure of their success to her paving the way for their books.<br /><br />Yes, I am an adult lover of Twilight, but by no means the only one, and I don't think that my children are going suffer because of my personal tastes in literature. Dozens of my GR friends (all adults) have given this book 4-5 stars and are not afraid to say that they love it too. Even my husband's uncle (a guy no less:-)) loved the series. My viewpoint may not be the popular one right now, but I still stand by everything I said in my review.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Presenting a well-reasoned defense of my own opinions has always made much more sense to me than bashing someone else for their opinions. The former can diffuse tension between two people while the latter usually only leads to greater tension, arguing and hurt feelings. I hate drama, so I always opt for the first.;-)]]></body>

He told her not to do anything reckless. It was her choice. He didn't know she'd jump off a cliff. And she wasn't trying to kill herself. She wanted a rush. As for the whole watching her while she sleeps. Vampires in this story don't sleep!! What's wrong with watching over her while SHE does. And besides he stopped aging when he became a vampire so he's still technically 17. Don't take offense but I think it is YOU who are wrong. EDWARD IS MY GODDAMN FUTURE HUSBAND!!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Julianna: Sorry I didn't respond earlier ): but I was super busy. Yeah, everyone does see books differently but I'm not debating with you guys on whether the book is bad or good. I don't care about that. The book us seriously DISTURBING.<br />Not just Edward- even though he is a creepy stalker- but the main character, Bella, is a prissy girl who can't stand up to herself and let's Edward do everything for her. I swear, my DOG is a better heroine then her. Yeah. She's sixteen. She sleeps all day. BETTER HEROINE. So, I'm not trying to change or bash your opinion, I just can't see how you don't see these things too. Read Perks of Being a Wallflower. I read it last night. Really good. Thank yoouuuu]]></body>
