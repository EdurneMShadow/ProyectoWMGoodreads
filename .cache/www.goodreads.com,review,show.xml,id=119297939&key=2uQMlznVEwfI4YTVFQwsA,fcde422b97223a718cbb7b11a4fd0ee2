  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winning will make you famous. &lt;br /&gt;Losing means certain death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, is a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by 12 poorer districts. Early in its history, a rebellion led by a 13th district against the Capitol resulted in its destruction and the creation of an annual televised event known as the Hunger Games. In punishment, and as a reminder of the power and grace of the Capitol, each district must yield one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 through a lottery system to participate in the games. The 'tributes' are chosen during the annual Reaping and are forced to fight to the death, leaving only one survivor to claim victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives. , she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature.</description>

Just a little make-up to change her skin tone, hair dye, some mud to smear on her face and we've got ourselves a kick-ass heroine.<br /><br />I really need to watch Winter's Bone just to confirm that her acting skills are as good as I think they are. I'm sure that I have nothing to worry about though. The girl was nominated for an Oscar after all.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Jennifer Lawrence was phenomenal in Winter's Bone and could probably be good as Katniss. However, I do have some reservations as well. I know they can get around the skin tone/hair color with make up, contacts etc. But I think it struck as incredibly tone-deaf that when the casting call went out for the role, they didn't even want the <i>possibility</i> that a bi-racial actresses might try out for the role, asking for caucasian actresses only. Fine and dandy they probably they would not have cast a true unknown in the role anyway, but still would it have killed them to let a sistah try out? <br /><br />Also JL is 21 right now. She was only 18/19 when WB was filming for a character that was 17 y.o. She just seems, well, old. Especially if they want to make this all the way out to Mockinjay. She'll be damn near 30 by that time. LOL. <br /><br />For all the fans of the book, though, I hope she knocks it out the park!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with you about the "white" issue, Tina. They were seriously considering Hailee Steinfeld who does have an Asian background and really has the look, but I think they were concerned about getting such young actress.<br /><br />Many actors play teenagers into their thirties. I mean look at the entire cast of Grease! And even most of the Glee actors are in their mid to late twenties.<br /><br />I think that there are a lot of issues that come with hiring younger actors, especially an entire cast of them. Having an older girl as the lead opens them up to a wider casting age for all of the other characters. If they had hired a 14 year old for Katniss, then they would have needed to base the age of all the other actors around that. They would have needed a Peeta under 18 as well. And Gale. And so on and so forth. There is a lot of time constraints when working with younger actors and it would be a nightmare, in the eyes of the studio, to have a whole slew of them with such a controversial and heavy movie. Not to mention the scheduling and long hours that are involved in making such a blockbuster series.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Yeah, it was the fact that they didn't even open casting up to biracial actors that bothered me. If they'd picked Jennifer after seeing a wider range of actors, it wouldn't bother me as much as it does. Not that I think she's a bad actress, I've never heard of her before this so I have no idea, though I heard she was great in Winter's Bone so at least it's not another Kristen Stewart who can't act situation.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Lynds, your photoshopping abilities are becoming eerily good. I'm already dreading what image you'll sear into my brain next.<br /><br />Personally, I never pictured Katniss as she looks in that drawing. The girl they picked is a little too white, but I don't think it's something that can't be fixed with a little makeup. Because, except for the "olive skin" part, I don't remember Katniss being described as being of mixed race or having any strong ethnic features.<br /><br />I think of this in a reverse way: would I see Katniss in an asian, black or latin american girl? My answer is no. Anyway, it's a movie. I don't usually (probably never) watch a movie after I read the book. The other way around is fine, but once I have my mental picture of a character, anyone real seems wrong.]]></body>

The casting for that series was perfect. Freddie Highmore was perfect for Charlie Bucket. Alice Upside Down, also perfect. Shiloh as well. Howl's Moving Castle was better than the book. There are a few others, but I can't remember them right now.<br /><br />I don't think Jennifer could be a great Katniss appearance wise--I know nothing about her acting skills--, mainly because I didn't imagine her looking like that. I thought she was bi-racial. And the people who're saying that my theory is ridiculous are the same people that say Rachel from Glee isn't white. The make-up thing to me is somewhat ridiculous. A person of color can't put on some bleach and play a white character so why should it be any different?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Mediterranean can mean anything. Historically, that area has a very diverse make-up. They count Arabs as white, but many of them are anything but. But I definitely understand having your own image of a character in your head. Of course, we're in America where no-one is really ever pure white or pure black. It's the culture you identify with more than anything, rather than your genetic racial make-up. <br /><br />I think that's the problem here. If producers refuse to have open casting when there's just a little misunderstanding from the fans, I think that's a problem. Especially when there are so few role-models for people of color. Yet we have Harry Potter, Twilight, and now the Hunger Games with nearly all white casts. I'm not saying it's necessarily right or wrong, it's just interesting that we still don't have open casting on movies that cost more than 100mill to make. But if it's a Tyler Perry movie, a Harpo Production, or Wes Craven needs a token character, PoCs are suddenly needed. <br /><br />I'd feel differently if the only black character in the series didn't die in the first film, but as it stands it's just sort of weird that she pointed out that only Rue and Thresh weren't white. It's kind of like saying everyone else is. Which is pretty much--at least according to the New York Times--the exact opposite of the future.<br /><br />Anyway, that Jackniss picture is still weirding me out Lyndsey. If you keep on honing your photoshop skills, you might need to get a separate deviantart account.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Cory, I think that mixed ethnicity may have been her point with the whole "everyone in the seam has olive toned skin" thing. Peeta is basically described as a rare commodity with his pale skin and blonde hair. As well as Prim.<br /><br />Also, I don't necessarily see race when I read about characters anyway. Even Rue - I never really pictured her as black or white. It's hard to explain.<br /><br />Even with books where race is clearly defined. Like Shipbreaker, which is extremely racially diverse. Some characters are described as very dark. But I don't really see that as I'm reading. I just see their features and facial expressions as I personally imagine them.<br /><br />Really Peeta and Prim were the only ones that I had a clear racial background idea of as far as the main characters go. Well, and Effie. I imagine that Effie is very white as well.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I never saw Rue as black. It's funny, I just have some sort of weird mixed race in my head for everyone except Peeta and Pris and their mother. I never thought of Katniss as black, but definitely imagined Gale to at least look hispanicish. Maybe they'll open the casting up for the other actors. I know Dakota Fanning's little sister would be good for Prim.<br /><br />I'm very with your there Morgan. Just because I see a character as a certain race--unless it is specifically told to us what they are--the best actor should be chose. I mean, when I was reading Harry Potter, I thought Oliver Wood was black. But his actor was perfect for the role anyway. And I thought Blaise Zabini was white, but his actor fit him. At first I was upset when they announced Lavender Brown's actor, but she was perfect for the role they wrote in the movie. Although I'm wondering why they took a took a different route with her character. Anyway, even just a open casting call would have quashed this to being with. Same with the Akira movie. Just a little bit of understanding and common sense goes a long way.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[You never thought of Rue as black? Huh. I thought her race was pretty explicit there. Its funny how people interpret descriptions so differently sometimes. <br /><br />I have to admit, when I see a character casted as an entirely different race than what I expected, I am put off. I don't think thats because of the race entirely, probably any radically different physical appearance would take some getting used to. However, casting directors usually have a good reason for it, going for the personality and acting skills over just physical appearance. <br /><br />I thought Lavender Brown was perfect :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Honestly, I didn't think of Katniss as being a PoC as I was reading it. but strangely, I also didn't think of her as being, well, "white" either simply because as you point out, the difference of Peeta &amp; Prim being blonde and pale as being something specifically pointed to the in the text. I got a feeling that the everybody by that time had, sorta just all blended into one hue, with Peeta, Prim and Rue being outliers, so to speak. I think I was just shocked to see the very blonde Jennifer Lawrence cast followed by the the text of the casting call. It just struck me as unnecessary condition for the call given that pretty much every "race" has persons with olive skin.]]></body>

I thought she was kind of Luna-ish too. <br /><br />Hopefully, more casting directors will start turning color blind, but as it stands, many aren't. The turn out of movies in 2010 should say enough about that. What's the biggest movie out with PoC for 2010 in America?<br /><br />For Colored Girls. Could it get anymore obvious?<br /><br />That being said, I wish actors would get randomly picked on race. You get equally good actors for one role of all races, then you toss their names in a hat and pick one. Now that would eliminate all bias, but I don't think it'll ever be done. <br /><br />Tina: Lisa Bonet is half black/half Jewish and she's pretty pale. Her husband, Lenny Kravitz is also half black/half Jewish, but other than his jew-fro, you wouldn't be able to tell that he wasn't black. Then you have Rebecca Walker who's also half black/half Jewish and she looks it too. It's sad that they'll never be able to try out for roles that call for white actors, but they get the a-ok if the movie calls for black actors.]]></body>

Look at Jackson Rathbone's make-up job in The Last Airbender. That was terrible. So much for slapping on a tan. And Rosalie looked terrible in Twilight. I won't even comment on that wig they gave Taylor Lautner to wear. <br /><br />Hopefully her acting will be up to par though.
