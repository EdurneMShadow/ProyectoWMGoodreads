  <description>&lt;i&gt;Night&lt;/i&gt; is Elie Wiesel's masterpiece, a candid, horrific, and deeply poignant autobiographical account of his survival as a teenager in the Nazi death camps. This new translation by Marion Wiesel, Elie's wife and frequent translator, presents this seminal memoir in the language and spirit truest to the author's original intent. And in a substantive new preface, Elie reflects on the enduring importance of Night and his lifelong, passionate dedication to ensuring that the world never forgets man's capacity for inhumanity to man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Night&lt;/i&gt; offers much more than a litany of the daily terrors, everyday perversions, and rampant sadism at Auschwitz and Buchenwald; it also eloquently addresses many of the philosophical as well as personal questions implicit in any serious consideration of what the Holocaust was, what it meant, and what its legacy is and will be.</description>

      <![CDATA[I had put off reading this story for a variety of reasons, main among them that I knew what I would be facing, and was eager to find an excuse not to. After having been to the Dachau Concentration Camp in Germany, the images of the now-dead ovens still linger somewhere in the recesses of my mind,...]]>

  <body><![CDATA[Like you said, knowing that the world the author described wasn't a make-believe world and existed once, makes you feel scared but also disgusted at the cruelty that creeps in the minds of people. And i do have to agree that this book was very deep but if i were Jewish then this book would've been much more personal. I think one part that was very sad to me was when Moshe, Eleizer's teacher, was deported but came back giving news that the German secret police were taking charge of trains and then taking everyone in the woods and butchering them, no one believed him. I thought this was sad because if they believed him i think that the people couldn't had a better chance of surviving instead of being sent to Sighet and then concentration camps. What is your take on this idea?]]></body>
