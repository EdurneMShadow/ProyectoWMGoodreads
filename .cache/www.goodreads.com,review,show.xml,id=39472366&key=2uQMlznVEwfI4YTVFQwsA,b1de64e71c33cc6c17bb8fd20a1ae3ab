  <description>Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and inspiring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids. Along the way he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles along the way. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[hah! love it ...<br /><br />Manny, he seriously with absolutely no whiff of ironic intent, puts this at the end of a chapter:<br /><br /><i>"The boy remembered an old proverb from his country. It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn."</i><br /><br />This followed an especially moving (&lt;-irony) piece of dialogue, that went like this (I'm sorry to subject you to this, but it must be done):<br /><i><br />" "My heart is a traitor," the boy said to the alchemist, when they had paused to rest the horses. "It doesn't want me to go on."<br /><br />" "That makes sense," the alchemist answered. "Naturally it's afraid that, in pursuing your dream, you might lose everything you've won."<br /><br />" "Well, then, why should I listen to my heart?"<br /><br />" "Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if you pretend not to have heard what it tells you, it will always be there inside you, repeating to you what you're thinking about life and about the world."<br /><br />" "You mean I should listen, even if it's treasonous?"<br /><br />" "Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly. If you know your heart well, it will never be able to do that to you. Because you'll know its dreams and wishes, and will know how to deal with them.<br /><br />" "You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it's better to listen to what it has to say. That way, you'll never have to fear an unanticipated blow."

  <body><![CDATA[I loved your phrase, "Twitter-sized bites of nonsense." The whole book felt like a pathetically sincere attempt to write Coelho's own book of quotable quotes. <br /><br />I'm with you in that I don't understand the mass appeal of such complete drivel. It's even worse than a Twinkie. At least when I indulge in a Twinkie, it tastes good. It wasn't any sort of pleasure to read this book. I found myself doing the same thing as you-- continuing to read, almost hopefully, please, PLEASE tell me this thing somehow redeems itself in the end. <br /><br />But no. <br /><br />On another note, I am going to be humming that damn Celine Dion song the rest of the day. ;)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA['tis true, jo. C cracks me up too. I need to comment more often.<br /><br />I thought I had responded to you both, but obv I went off on some rant in my head and didn't actually write it down.<br /><br />Jo - thank you. Wilde said, if you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh or else they'll kill you. This is so true. I think parody/satire really is the only way to respond to this kind of thinking, and to people who seek and are taken in by Easy. But sometimes even satire isn't enough to defuse the threat. Tina Fey should get a Nobel Peace Prize (maybe Obama should share his) for her undermining of the McCain/Palin campaign. But here come the Tea Partiers....<br /><br />Ceridwen -- thank you too! And I hope you read my own disgust for "god gives you only what you can handle" and the other beliefs I cited. These particular platitudes are just one step away from blaming the victim, aren't they? And they are the logical corollaries (among others) to what The Alchemist espouses. <br /><br />It comes down to believing that the Universe is an ordered, fated place versus believing it's a random and uncaring one. It's so fascinating to read the 1-star and 5-star reviews of this. Talk about two separate camps! I'm convinced it's a religious/political divide, too, whether the raters see this novel for the religious/political agenda it has or not.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>And I hope you read my own disgust for "god gives you only what you can handle" and the other beliefs I cited. These particular platitudes are just one step away from blaming the victim, aren't they? And they are the logical corollaries (among others) to what The Alchemist espouses. </i><br /><br />Oh, totally, I got that. I've only heard that one used by people when they're telling others to suck it up, like there's a cap on suffering, like if you can't abide your own suffering you've failed God. I've seen people break because of their suffering, and I dislike the notion that they are morally suspect because of it. Empathy! More empathy! <br /><br />Oh, and hey, I say this great little webby thing this morning from Barbara Ehrenreich called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5um8QWWRvo" rel="nofollow">Smile or Die</a>.]]></body>

Love the Ehrenreich clip...I've been meaning to put her book on my to-read list. I'm enjoying the reviews here of it.<br /><br />That "God only gives you..." I also think people use it almost as a prayer to ward off evil from themselves. As though misfortune can be caught, like a virus. Sometimes even benignly, as though if they say it and misfortune does strike them, having said it they will have the strength to bear the tragedy. There's some kind of quality to it that feels like an invocation.<br /><br />It's one of those meaningless things that people say when they really just don't know what to say.]]></body>

Not all of them have been great, but some of them have been outstanding. I think I'll go and make a shelf for the ones I probably never would have read if not for GR friends' reviews ....]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Jason, you've got me thinking about quantifying my reading experience. And thus:<br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1379742898i/81116.jpg" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><br>Not shown here, the range of books read per month: 0 to 6 (this month I will probably read 7, if not 8).<br><br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1379742898i/81117._SX540_.jpg" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><br>While I did not do a T-test for significance (is that the test I'm supposed to do? It's been a while!), I would say that this shows decidedly - both by avg rating and distribution of ratings - that the books I'm reading "only because of Goodreads" are enhancing my overall reading experience.<br><br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1379742898i/81118.jpg" class="gr-hostedUserImg"><br><br>N.B.: here, "recommenders" doesn't necessarily mean formally. It means that, if not for these GRers' comments and/or reviews, I would not have read the books I did. These are the books (a sub-set of the GR-recommended above) that I can directly link to a specific GRer. And this shows even more unequivocally that Goodreads as a source of reading recommendations is, for me, invaluable.<br><br>Finally: there are authors I've read because of GR that I likely never would have read, including: Tim O'Brien, James Morrow (shout out to Ko!), Jhumpa Lahiri, Haruki Murakami (shout out to Ben!), Jonathan Safran Foer. And I finally broke some kind of barrier I had around Toni Morrison by being spurred to read her by comments here. That's a pretty impressive list, no?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[oh yes, you're a <i>huge</i> part of it, jo! Your reviews/comments have led me to Jhumpa Lahiri and Toni Morrison. Plus, while I had <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5211.A_Fine_Balance" title="A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry" rel="nofollow">A Fine Balance</a> sitting on my shelf, it was your recommendation that made me read it. So, thank <i>you</i>.<br /><br />This was a really interesting process; it forced me to go back to my ratings and rationalize them, fill in all those "recommended by" boxes in my reviews, plus look at the trends.<br /><br />It would be kind of cool if GR would automatically generate these kinds of descriptive stats (instead of the pretty meaningless ones they do right now).]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[EM, must be a fellow INTP thing, but I could see myself digging around in numbers and charts like you've done. If I wasn't such a excel caveman, I'd set something up like this.<br /><br />Have you noticed the 'stats' link on the left hand side of your 'My Books' page. It took several months and thousands of inputs from several hundred members in the GR Feedback group to get that together.<br /><br />When I'm 'shopping' around for books on GR, one of the factors I put into the equation (besides friend star ratings) is the overall average rating and how many people have read the book. I really wish we could manipulate that number and break out demographics by age, sex, nationality, etc. Again, INTP, but I put a little stock in the raw data.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Once you do that, if you really want to see your stats and you're not just poking fun at my geekiness, flip your .csv output to me (i know, i know, that sounds sexy beyond words). I'd be happy to do your stats up in a purty chart for you.</i><br /><br />Oh, I wasn't making fun, at least not of you. I have no idea what a .csv is. I don't have a statistical mind, so I did a really quick and dirty analysis. I had some trouble assigning specific books to either category - like the children's book Chandra reminded me of, and I knifed out like a crazy person and bought it. Really, Grandma recommended it, but I own it now because of GR. And then you get into weird things like children's books - I read a lot of them, because I have kids, and I have taken recommendations from GR, but the ones I have listed on GR are seriously selective - I'm just not going to review every single kid's book I read, because that would be like 5 a week. Maybe I should cut them out of the data. But I haven't. <br /><br />Out of the 140 books I read not because of GR, I get an average rating of 3.1. Out of the 26 books I've read because of GR, I get an average rating of 3.4. If you cut out the two First Reads one-star shitstorms, because they we're so much recommended as mailed to my house on a dare, then you get and average rating of 3.6. <br /><br />Also, I can't go back and sort this all out, but I see I've gotten several good recs from Mike, Manny, Elizabeth, Meredith, Miriam and Eh!, sometimes for the same book. The largest number of book recs come from my husband, for sure, although often he recommends stuff that he knows will make me insane, just to watch the ensuing rampage/freak out. He does not always warn me that this is the case. There are several irl friends who keep me in good books, and two, notably, whose recommendations I should never again heed.]]></body>

So it's not that they are indiscriminate, it's that they are less publicly negative. I've also seen weirdos who rate really low just because they're trying personally to counteract the omg-sparkly-pony-5-stars-all-around reviewers - and there are a lot of the sparkle kind, to be sure. I like the little graph you get when you click on a person's average rating. I expected everyone to have a bell curve - that's what mine looks like - but, boy, is that NOT the case.]]></body>

I had to do some 'real' work today. Imagine!<br /><br /><i>Ceridwen wrote: "Oh, I wasn't making fun, at least not of you. I have no idea what a .csv is.

I'll answer the .csv in more detail, but basically it's just a format for exporting all of your GR to an excel spreadsheet.<br /><br />Your analysis seems to indicate a slight positive difference with GR influence versus without, even though you've got some confounding variables in the form of kiddie lit; a shit-disturbing husband; and one-star dare reads (which I think took the form of a lusty wench and a seaman?). <br /><br />And bottom line, all these stats are just descriptive not prescriptive or inferential. I think we do a filtering at an almost a sub-conscious level when it comes to figuring out the value of a rec which takes into consideration all the variables you are both identifying. It would certainly be possible to build a model for that. Hmmmmm. Maybe a late-summer project. Naaaah. I'd rather actually, you know, <i>read</i> something.<br /><br />What we choose to read is definitely a combination of our knowledge (sometimes spotty) of what people like and <i>are</i> like, how accurately and thoroughly they review and we infer. And our own reading histories, preferences, values, etc.<br /><br />My rating stats skew high, I know. I'm getting more analytical (obviously) and more discerning (perhaps less obviously, given that I chose to read <i>The Alchemist</i>) about what I read and how I think about what I read. <br /><br />Later, gaterz. Have a great [rest of the:] afternoon.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This review approaches perfection. The statistical analysis ain't too shabby either, though if you were contemplating a formal significance test of GR versus non-GR ratings, a Wilcoxon test might be preferable to the t-test, given the forced discreteness of the rating distribution. <br /><br />When making a decision based on GR feedback regarding a particular book, I seem to end up weighting the opinions of certain folks highly, rather than going with an overall average. But I think that's what we tend to do in life in general anyway. (Which is what EM just wrote in her most recent post) <br /><br />What I like best about GR is the number of books I've been motivated to read that I otherwise would either have not known or not taken the trouble to read.<br /><br />Y'all are just enabling my addictive behavior...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This is a great thread, for such a terrible book. Note: I haven't reviewed it. My stars skew high--and shouldn't stars skew high? just sayin'--'cause I tend not to finish 1- or even as many 2-star books. And I'm one of those Ceridwen references who often sidesteps reviewing/rating the stinkers. Some deserve it, as here, and lord knows I LOVE reading really great bad reviews. Sometimes I'm just trying to be polite, if the writers might be lurking around, so I don't throw down. <br /><br />But more often the problem is that my own snarky sarcastic dismissals tend to be rather boring. I found this when I had a brief gig reviewing films. It was wicked easy to write a destroy-all-monsters bit of mugging. But DAMN it's hard for me to write a review of something I really love. So I try to write and rate mostly to push myself to consider and reflect on appreciation.<br /><br />And that's why I read so obsessively on this site, too. I'm less likely to seek recommendations on GR than to delight in the brilliant appreciations (and abhorrences) that smart reading produces. Certainly I look to what y'all are reading to think about where to go next, but I frankly adore this group of readers because I love to read what YOU write. You make me think about reading--as much as (or more than) what to read.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I'm not dissing, Mike, if that wasn't entirely clear. I think you're right its really easy to bash instead of praise. My own review of five star books often <s>veer into</s> live in incoherent. I was trying to point out, sloppily, that the average rating of a person's own reads often has more to do with their understanding of the rating system - some folk see 3 as a bad rating; I don't; I think it is quite good - and what they review. For example, I can take the 15 books I've abandoned out of the 173 books I've rated and then my average rating is up to 3.24. Okay, that's still not very high, but it doesn't really make me more discriminating, just crankier. :)<br /><br /><i>and one-star dare reads (which I think took the form of a lusty wench and a seaman?).</i><br /><br />Actually, I left in the wench and the seaman, because they were part of a group read, and I truly would not have read them if not for GR. (And there are two other books I read for that group that I did like.) I left out two First Reads books - no one really recommended them, other than my own idle curiosity and the lure of free stuff. Then there are weird cases like Anne Carson's verse novel, which was recommended to me by a real live human friend because she had seen my review of <i>Sharp Teeth</i> on GR. <i>Sharp Teeth</i> was originally recommended by D. Pow's &amp; David G's excellent reviews. And this is not the only time a real life friend, who is also a friend on goodreads, pushed something into my hands because of a review. So the recommendation providence is weird.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Ceridwen wrote: "I'm not dissing, Mike, if that wasn't entirely clear."</i><br /><br />Oh, it was--and I wasn't dissing you, whether or not you were dissing. I think your point that even with a "shared" 5-point scale we're still often reviewing in very different registers is dead right.<br /><br />And, for the record, the only "bad" reviews I think aren't often worth reading are my own. I just don't write as interestingly when disinterested, or even when actively disgusted. But others--like EM here, or you--write fantastically when dissing. David K is a whiz at bashing, and even when he's (wrongheadedly) knocking a favorite of mine, he's often (like you, like EM) just brilliantly clear about why he dislikes. That's the key for me: I want smart people telling me WHY their reading passions swing up or down the scale...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Mike wrote: "This is a great thread, for such a terrible book. "</i><br /><br />More irony!<br /><br />Thank you for the great comments and compliments, Mike. I love that you get something completely different from GR than most of the rest of us do, and that I can contribute that. It makes me feel less guilty for pinching all your recommendations mostly without your knowledge. ;-) <br /><br /><i>Jason wrote: "EM, this single review has dwarfed in popularity all those other reviews you've written in relative obscurity. You should be writing 1-star reviews exclusively ;) "</i><br /><br />And yet more irony! (and also a rather frightening implication--fortunately, I'm all about the quality, not the quantity.)<br /><br /><i>Ceridwen wrote: "I think you're right its really easy to bash instead of praise. " </i>and<i> "I left in the wench and the seaman,..."</i><br /><br />I'm seeing why your bell curve is more normally distributed now (although this year's is skewing more to the high side). <br /><br />This goes back to what started my thinking off here, which was Jason's comment on another thread about how quickly we read. I don't have time to read bad books; I'm too slow a reader. So normally, I do as Mike does: put them aside once they head firmly into 1 or 2-star territory and usually do not review.<br /><br />I made an exception here just 'coz this one was so easy to poke fun at.<br /><br />At the risk of getting all serious, I had a thought earlier this week that what if I lived in a totalitarian regime, where state writers churned out <i>The Alchemist</i>s exclusively (because yes, I DO think this book has a political agenda) and: a) that was all you had to read; and b) you couldn't respond freely and honestly to it as a critical thinker?<br /><br />So I don't consider an honest, critical review of a one-star book--even a parody, like this one--to be bashing (and may I suggest that the people who do would be more inclined to love this book and its ideas--the "think positive" cult strikes again!). There's no personal attack here. It's an attack on the ideas the book espouses and how they are expressed. That is fair game, as far as I am concerned. The thing is, rarely will I devote that kind of time and attention to writing a review for a 1-star book, when I could instead be reading a 3, 4 or 5-star one.<br /><br />'course, this thread interaction and the vote thing is sort of narcotic-like. I feel all warm and squishy inside. <br /><br />Group hug?<br /><br /><i>Miriam wrote: "Dang, I guess I should have read Skye O'Malley after all! Quick, somebody recommend some crap that's short! "</i><br /><br />Scroll up, way up. I have just the book for you. :-D]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This is such a great review and such a great thread. I went out with a woman once who recommended I read this book, but I couldn't finish it. And I was weak and said to her, "Yes, I can see why it might change someone's life" - something I've been ashamed of since. But I don't think I went out with her again after reading the 50 pages of this book I could bring myself to finish so I don't feel so bad about myself in the end.]]></body>
