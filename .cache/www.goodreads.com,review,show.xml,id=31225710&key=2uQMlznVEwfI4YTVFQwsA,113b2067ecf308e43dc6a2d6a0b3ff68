  <description>Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and inspiring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids. Along the way he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles along the way. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Ahh...I think you are consumed by the invisible force that is described in the book, funny :) The older you get the less you believe in your dreams. You start to see "reality". You stop to become .. "naive"? <br /><br />You know, I believe in reality most of what people build around themselves is excuses. They still know, in the depth of their hearts that they are abandoning their dreams and so they exchange them for the grown-up causes that you can't really refuse or argue with(love for your partners or children). They make of it the either-or case. Don't forget that the book is allegory taken to the extreme, noone says you have to completely abandon everyone, life has more shades than black/white. You can work on your dreams at least bit by bit. <br /><br />I also strongly believe in the "you come first". Selfish? I don't think so. I really think that you are doing GOOD to others by living this philoshophy. <br /><br />Why? Well, this is explained in the book as well but you probably didn't get it(or didn't want to?:), as you prove in this paragraph:<br /><br />"Santiago has a wonderful, fulfilling life laid out before him, and would most likely die a happy man by the side of his lovely wife and adoring children, all while living comfortably as village counselor of a beautiful desert oasis."<br /><br />Thats what he thinks at first, but then the Alchemist tells him how it turns out - he gets bitter by not following his dreams, his wife sees it year by year. Because of that he stops to see the omens(the universe stops collaborating), he loses his counselor job in turn.. <br /><br />Not going to happen? Then look around. World is full of bitter parents who didn't realize their dreams for the "greater good of others". Now they transform their bitternes to their children, they try to throw their unfullfilled ambitions at them, sometimes quite heavily. If those people followed their "selfish" ambitions, they would be happy, fullfilled and they wouldn't use their children as a tool for their own goals or desires. <br /><br />It's just one example, but in general, if I was listening what my father said I should study, I would never be sucessfull in the field tham I'm in now. It's because only YOU know what you want and whats best for you(and in turn, how you can benefit the others by doing so). If I wasn't selfish and if I listened to my father, I would be working in uninspiring job, I wouldn't contribute much really to the society because I would be quite lazy in doing what is uninspiring - that all because I wasn't "selfish" back then. Instead I was selfish not caring about what my father wanted and could create a thing that so many people around the world enjoyed few years later in turn. Is that still selfish, in the big picture?<br /><br />And about the treasue - you have to understand that the treasue is allegory. The writer had methapore in his own career, where he did the opposite of what you are describing, he gave up his well-paying job as song writer and became a book writer, which was certainly not a clear pot of gold for him.<br /><br />Now certainly your real dream might be as well to live a normal average life with people you love, nothing against that. Each has to decide, but I believe if you really want something you'll find a way, and if your peers really love you they will understand, sooner or later, otherwise it's all excuses - that's the message. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I think any parent who pushes their fallen dreams on a child has issues that go beyond their failed dreams. You clearly understand that every choice we make in life is our own, and we have to take responsibility for that. If someone chooses to start a family and become a businessman instead of an artist, that's a conscious decision. If he comes to resent that, he is resenting his own wants and desires, at least at a previous point in time.<br /><br />You have to appreciate the beauty in the world you make for yourself, whether that's making music that people enjoy the world over or working every day in an office. Let me ask you this--how many people selfishly pursue their dreams and don't make it? I'd venture to guess the majority of them. And do you think every one of them is happy and content with their choices, secure in the knowledge that they gave it their best shot? Maybe, but that can be cold comfort, can't it? Perhaps in another world you wouldn't have been so successful in your chosen field; perhaps you'd be a miserable failure and look back at your choices and say you wished you'd listened to your father and studied. Who is to say?<br /><br />The point is that if you're unhappy with your life, regardless of the decisions you've made, you will have regrets about the road not taken. Whether you pursue your dreams or choose a different path, happiness is the only result that matters.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Great review, Patrick. I was trying to differentiate the reviews. Many of them seemed to be angry at a "follow your bliss" premise (which is often misunderstood), rather than critiquing the book itself. From your review (literal treasure - really?), I'm convinced that the book probably went off the rails in both directions. Shame. Fiction has enormous potential to illustrate that the 'bliss' referred to by great teachers has nothing to do with princes, places or porches... or treasures in the dessert. I'll skip it, and keep looking for New Thought fiction I can actually recommend. Thanks for your help with that.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I think this guy is hitting the point well on the head. As corny as it sounds one of the largest deciding factors as to whether someone will love or hate The Alchemist lies in whether they are able to open up themselves to believe in the theme and idea of the "personal Legend" It is frightening to risk the safety, and certainty of a day to day, mundane life. it is like the book pulls you right in, and makes you choose just like the protagonist.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Patrick, I really wonder what's your opinion about the book after another 8 years have passed. From my perspective I think that you were just behind the book's message a couple of years in your own life, that you just didn't experience yourself the second half of the story. And I think you highly oversimplified the message. The treasure at the end was not important at all, it was just a fulfillment, but the real treasures Santiago found on his way there. But as unrest souls cannot be tamed without pursuing their destinies, Santiago must have done everything he did up to the very end, so he could live his life with Fatima without wondering "what if". Don't you wonder yourself "what if"?]]></body>
