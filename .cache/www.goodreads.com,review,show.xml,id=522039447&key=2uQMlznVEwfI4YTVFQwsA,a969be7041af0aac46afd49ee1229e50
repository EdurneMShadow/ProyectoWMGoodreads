  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?</description>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Michael wrote: "haha, so many spoiler tags"</i><br /><br />That's just to inject some suspense into my review ;)<br /><br />Seriously, I honestly tried to be good here. So many people complain about spoilers in reviews (unlike me, other people actually care about not knowing where the plot goes. I am one of the people who are not adverse to glancing at the last page from time to time, and who clicks on all spoiler links - but I appear to be in the minority).]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Michael wrote: "I have to wonder why you would read reviews if you don't want to know about the book"</i><br /><br />Well, I was wondering the same, and then someone brought up the idea that there are 'pre-read' reviews (to decide if you like the idea of the book - but with no possibility of spoilers) and 'post-read' reviews (the ones to read after you already read the book and are looking for others' opinions about it - or for people like me who are indifferent towards spoilers). I am not that good with the former and better with the latter - but since so many people really think that knowing something about the book in advance ruins their reading experience, I try to be careful about major spoilers just in case.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I love that you spoiler tag! That's what it's there for, and I thank goodreads, because I'm a total spoiler-phobe. That being said I actually hate even vague spoilers so much that I kind of agree, I don't usually read reviews on books I haven't read. Sometimes I'll just glance at the beginning, but I've been burned before. Anyway, props to you and your multiple spoiler tagging.<br /><br />I've read all of Flynn's books now and Dark Places is definitely my favorite. I was disappointed by Sharp Objects, especially in retrospect, now that the page turning high has worn off. This one falls in the middle.]]></body>

Go was probably the only one who was tolerable, honestly.]]></body>

Dark Places was the most psychologically intense, with the best developed characters. Gone Girl was my second favorite. I found Sharp Objects (her second novel) to be quite a letdown. <br /><br />I also found Go to be the most interesting character, but I don't think she was developed enough. She seemed almost like a foil, a side-kick.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Haha, despite being a three-star rating, you made me want to read this book more! I already have it, just haven't gotten around to reading it yet. One of my pet peeves is inconsistency, though... I hate it when I encounter it in a book. Hopefully, once I read this, it wouldn't bother me too much. Thanks for the review, Nataliya!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[A review of this book DEMANDS multiple spoiler tags, so it was considerate of you to include them. My <i>Gone Girl</i> review is littered with spoiler tags, and it took me so much more time to write as a result. This book is very easy to spoil! Those who haven't read GG yet should be careful when reading other reviews!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>a brilliant sociopath who plans everything to perfection, suddenly turns into an incompetent pathetic creature who easily gets robbed by chance acquiantances and is easily fooled by Nick's 'heartfelt plea' on TV</i><br /><br />THANK YOU<br /><br />GOD, did that bug me. I actually had less difficulty with Nick turning over a new leaf because for him that's so tied to the child -- and it fits in with the theme of parents fucking their children up. But yeah, I was like, but she's NAIVE and acting stupid! Which maybe was the point, that once she was out-manipulated that was her basic skill set so she was sort of helpless, but I still didn't like it.<br /><br />This for me was absolute candy -- like Chelsea Caine's books: well-written but not anything I'd take that seriously. I will say that some of the nasty jokes in this book are a <i>lot</i> funnier if you're married -- I was reading some of them out to my husband and we were cracking up.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thank you so much for this review. It is the first review I have read of this book anywhere that I have completely agreed with! <br /><br />The first half of the book is an exercise in carefully built suspense and should be listed as Exhibit A in the dictionary under "Unreliable Narrators." I thought it bordered on brilliant and I was hooked. And Flynn's mastery of small details is admirable, to say the least.<br /><br />But the second half just asked me to suspend way too much disbelief. The characters just kept changing too quickly and the plot turns and dialogue both became ridiculous. And the "psychological insights" of the book are just pure hooey. There was nothing about Amy and Nick -- as human beings or a couple -- that ultimately rang anything close to true as people you would encounter in life or as representative of any particular mental disorder.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thanks for writing it, though I don't agree with your views on the second half. I was very interested by the depiction of the characters and thought that they were multi-dimensional. The quotes you gave (marked as spoilers) I was completely able to accept, and I thought also, that there was a total awareness in Nick that he was getting to play the 'hero' at the end. It's funny, but books are like this. We all like/accept different things. I thought the quote you gave from Nick was really perfect!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Hi, I have to disagree with you about what you see as the lapses/contradictions of character in the two characters in the second half of the book.<br /><br />Amy: she isn't easily fooled by Nick's plea on tv. She acknowledges out loud to him after she comes back that he was just saying what he did to get her come back. But she still likes him saying it and wants him to continue playing that "good husband who adores me" role, even if it's an act. She explicitly doesn't care if it's an act. <br /><br />Her character is consistent in "playing" and expecting others to play certain roles, regardless of what they feel. She plays "Cool Girl" for 2 years with Nick; all an act. She plays damsel in distress for Desi; all an act. And she wants Nick to play adoring husband for her, even if's all an act. At the very end, indeed:<blockquote>'My gosh, Nick, why are you so wonderful to me?' <br />He was supposed to say: You deserve it. I love you.<br />But he said,'Because I feel sorry for you.' <br />'Why?' <br />'Because every morning you have to wake up and be you.'</blockquote> She says "I wish he hadn't said that." Not because she cares how he really feels. She doesn't. But because he didn't say the line for the role that she wants him to play. That's all.<br /><br />And Nick, he certainly doesn't want to become a self-sacrificing Nice Guy. But as he tells us, he's afraid of Amy. Literally afraid of what she can do to his life. So he's cautious, with Amy holding the antifreeze laced vomit in reserve to back up an attempted murder charge on him if she wants to pin that on him. But he clearly doesn't like his wife or want to sacrifice for her, I mean he even chokes her to within an inch of her life that first night. And after throwing out the vomit, he finishes his book and is ready to take his chances and break away from Amy. But she gets him with the pregnancy. He does sacrifice, but for his unborn son, which we know is an idea that has always held an immense power over him because of his own father and upbringing.<br /><br />So these characters and events are extreme, of course, but the characterization seems consistent to me.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Exactly how I felt! I just HAD to finish it, was so engrossed, but hated the whole second half. Still a fun read because I liked being sucked in, but I wish the story would have unfolded better at the end. It almost felt like the author lost steam, and just went off the deep end with the storyline.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Get out of my head! Just finished the book yesterday and was discussing with my co-workers, and my main point of contention was the stupid decisions Amy,a brilliant (and I do mean brilliant) sociopath would make in the second half of the novel. It was a complete departure from what her character was set up to be, she was so naive. It made no sense. And I also agree with Nick's change also, the revealing of Amy's true nature did not necessarily make him seem more of a "nice guy", yet suddenly he assumed that role or rather readers were supposed to assume that was his role all along.<br />All that being said, I still liked the book as it was so engrossing.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Great review, and your opinion is so close to my own! I too found the first half awesomely compelling, only to be completely let down by the second half. I also had the same thought about Amy suddenly wanting Nick back; what a ridiculous betrayal of character for a woman we had just learned would stop at nothing for revenge.. Silliness. And it had so much potential. I felt that the author wanted to leave wiggle room for a sequel, depriving readers of the right story, the one we deserve.]]></body>
