  <description>With precisely 35 canvases to his credit, the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer represents one of the great enigmas of 17th-century art. The meager facts of his biography have been gleaned from a handful of legal documents. Yet Vermeer's extraordinary paintings of domestic life, with their subtle play of light and texture, have come to define the Dutch golden age. His portrait of the anonymous Girl with a Pearl Earring has exerted a particular fascination for centuries - and it is this magnetic painting that lies at the heart of Tracy Chevalier's second novel of the same title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Girl with a Pearl Earring&lt;/i&gt; centers on Vermeer's prosperous Delft household during the 1660s. When Griet, the novel's quietly perceptive heroine, is hired as a servant, turmoil follows. First, the 16-year-old narrator becomes increasingly intimate with her master. Then Vermeer employs her as his assistant--and ultimately has Griet sit for him as a model.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[The spare prose mimics Vermeer's careful use of light and shadow. I found the story to be what I consider historically accurate, especially in the description of the daily activities (and frustrations) of the Vermeer household. Theirs was a rigidly controlled society back then, where words were weapons and reputations, like virginity, could be lost forever in a moment. If the eighteen-year-old narrator spent a moment thinking over the implications of what the butcher just said, her reflection would not be inconsistent with a girl of her day... and the author's inclusion of that scene adds to the realism of the overall book. Your disappointment with this book indicates to me that you expected a modern novel, written in a modern style, instead of a novel based in the late 1600's and written with the (artfully imagined) voices and mannerisms of that period. Clearly, you will need to avoid Chevalier's other works, as they are also period pieces (which I have enjoyed tremendously). ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[The "stream of conscience" did not flesh out the characters for me. While I don;t expect characters to have modern attitude, I want to be able to understand the character's feelings and emotions. I could not connect the dots. Was Griet projecting the a crush she had on Vermeer onto Pieter? Did she feel nothing for Pieter, but only saw him as a way of escape from the Vermeer household? Or did she finally become attracted to the humanity she eventually saw in Pieter? Or . . . ? We never really find out what she is feeling and what her motivations were. With every man she met younger than 60 making moves on her, she likely could have found other fish in the sea besides Pieter if she was not attracted to him. (The dirty nails and apron??) I'm sensing I have the same dissppointment as the reviewer -- we don't know what the voices and the mannerisms of 300+ years ago were, but we do identify with universal human feelings -- they just need to be communicated a bit more clearly -- many things in this novel made no sense and would be helped by a beam of light here and there aimed toward where we needed to go.]]></body>
