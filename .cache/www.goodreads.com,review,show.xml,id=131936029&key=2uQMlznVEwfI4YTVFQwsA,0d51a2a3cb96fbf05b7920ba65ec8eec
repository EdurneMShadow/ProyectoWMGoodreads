  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[I love how everyone feels the need to write incredibly long reviews for this book - unfortunately b/c there is a lot to criticize. I made a lot of your points in my review, too. Check out the Comments on my review - some people had a different take on her decision to hold another Hunger Games (i.e., that it was a ploy).]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Yeah, I've heard a few different accounts of why people think Katniss voted for another hunger games and I'm not completely against authors allowing the readers to come to their own conclusions about things, but I just really felt that with something as huge as Katniss voting FOR the hunger games, we really shouldn't have to assume why she did it. It's a complete departure from what she has always believed and we should have been let in on her throught process the way we were in the past, the way we were for things that didn't matter as much like when Peeta basically says she's cold at heart and she wonders if that's what everyone thinks of her. It's the hugeness of the decision combined with not being informed as to why she voted that way that upset me. But then again, maybe it was genius of Suzanne to not tell us, because here we are talking about it...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Lyndsey wrote: "I just really felt that with something as huge as Katniss voting FOR the hunger games, we really shouldn't have to assume why she did it."</i><br /><br />I thought it was pretty clear that the reason Katniss voted for the Hunger Games was so she would have the opportunity to execute Coin, who showed herself to be every bit as ruthless and cruel as Snow, publicly. If Katniss had objected to the Games when Coin (and many others) wanted them to continue, Coin never would have allowed her to hold a bow anywhere near her. I think Collins was kind of coy writing that scene so she could have the spectacular twist when Katniss shoots Coin instead of Snow.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[That I could have completely gotten behind if Suzanne had later illustrated that was why she did it. But instead of standing behind her decision and declaring Coin's guilt, Katniss runs away and tries to commit suicide. I just wanted to know what was going on inside the mind of Katniss but it's never really revealed. It's just mush in there. Maybe that was what Collins was going for, the PTSD mindset associated with war: not knowing what is the right decision and just reacting instead. But I personally wanted more explanation.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[That's definitely what pissed me off, too. I think that it is because the so called "happily ever after" was just so bland and lifeless, I almost would have preferred a more tragic ending, as opposed to this ending that seemed to be there just to appease the hordes of Peeta fans. Like she just threw us out the leftovers. "Here you go. Happy?"]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[It's mean to say, but I kind of felt like they were used goods at that point and they stuck together because no one else wanted them.<br />She also said at the end that Peeta would have to hold onto things and try to struggle through his flashbacks and I wonder if she means the ones that made him want to kill her? Did he ever completely get over that? If not, that would be entirely too creepy to sleep next to someone who occasionally wanted to choke you.]]></body>

After everything she had been through and everything that she did for them?<br /><br />I mean, I get that she wanted to base it in reality and say that <i>this</i> is what war does, but she still could have gone about that in a different way. Or shown that sometimes against all odds, you can still pull through anyway.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I know what you mean. I have several alternate endings in my head, as well. I really just wish that she would have explained more. About Coin and what happened with all that crap. I still don't know why or how they found her guilty and freed Katniss.<br /><br />Maybe you're right. Maybe she just got tired of it or caved from the pressure. Or maybe that's how she planned it all along. Who knows?]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I've read a good deal of this page now, and i have to say there seems to be some inconsistencies between your rating and your review. How can you give a book 4 stars ...you "really liked it"...yet have so many issues with it? You've listed ten things you did not like or would like to change, but barely mention a single thing you liked. After reading this book i understand why you listed so many disappointments...but 4 stars? Lol i don't want to come across as an asshole, i just thought i would ask.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[@ Naru - I agree. Prim's death should have been the most dramatic, but it didn't have the impact on me that I would have expected. The only emotion I felt was with Finnick's death also, but I think we had more opportunities to know him as a character. Katniss' mom and sister really weren't given much depth or personality. <br /><br />@ Matt - You may have read a good deal of the page, but you didn't read all of it ;) Lyndsey addressed her 4 star rating toward the end of her review.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I did read that part Cat :p I just don't know if thats justified. I mean...don't we rate books on here based on how much we enjoyed them? If you didn't "really like it", i don't see a reason not to give it your honest rating. <br /><br />So im not just antagonizing here, i'll give my opinion on the series too. I think books 1 and 2 were a great start to the trilogy, but Mockingjay took a dark turn for the worst. It was morbid, and completely bummed me out. Not where i thought it was going. All in all i guess Lyndsey can rate as she wishes, i was just curious is all.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Matt, I completely understand where you are coming from, and trust me, I am usually not so gracious with my stars when I have so many gripes.<br /><br />I think the four stars is more "wishful thinking" on my part. Maybe it's for what I feel the book could have been and should have been.<br /><br />Also, I can disagree with things in the book but still feel like I came away a different person. I feel like I learned more about myself through this book. I also feel like I learned what NOT to do to my characters when I write a book, for example, isolate and detach them from the reader. So the book still holds a great deal of value to me, even though I personally disagree with some of the choices made by the author.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I think this review was spot on. I agree that Peeta's capture and subsequent torture was the only interesting storyline that emotionally involved me. The first two books were so full of passion and action, but the third book felt DEAD. And it didn't help when the author killed the one character who inspired Katniss to act in the first place: Prim. I know a lot of people are upset about Finnick's death, but when Prim died, I was totally stupefied and disgusted. What was the whole point of the series? Why did it end in such a dark way? Are we supposed to garner some kind of lesson from that ending? Fight to the death and then end up depressed and empty for the rest of your life? If the first two books hadn't been so amazing and ground-breaking, I wouldn't have felt so disappointed by Mockingjay, but it ended up leaving me feeling depressed and empty too.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[@ Jennifer - That was on my mind also, what message are we supposed to gather from this conclusion? I know toward the end Katniss says "..that life can go on, no matter how bad our losses". But after 20 years she still has times where she can't even enjoy her life with her children because she feels everything could be taken away. What a horrible way to live. I expected something more powerful or Katniss to have some kind of epiphany in the end. I agree with you that it just felt empty.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thanks Ken and Jennifer!<br /><br />My main regret about the book is that I didn't feel it more. Whether this is my own fault or Collins fault, I can't say for sure. But I should have felt stronger emotions while reading something so dark and intense. I wanted to feel the sadness but instead I felt emptiness.<br /><br />I also wonder what kind of effect this book would have on younger readers. It IS young adult after all, but I am not sure how maybe a pre-teen or someone in their early teens would handle this book. Would they be able to find hope in it when I could not? I hope so. For their own sake.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I absolutely loved your review. I did the same thing - started reading, and had to put it down. There it was, on my nightstand, doing flips and dancing naked, wanting me to pick it up. I couldn't bring myself to do it though. I was in a "Katniss" state of mind around this time, and couldn't beat myself up more. However, I'm glad I finished it, and all the questions that were unanswered? Well, I just hope the movies help fill some of the holes. (Here's to hoping).]]></body>
