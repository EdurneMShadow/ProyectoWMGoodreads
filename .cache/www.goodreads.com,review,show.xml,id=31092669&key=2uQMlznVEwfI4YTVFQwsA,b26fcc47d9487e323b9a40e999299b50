  <description>An ingenious code hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci. A desperate race through the cathedrals and castles of Europe. An astonishing truth concealed for centuries . . . unveiled at last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Nice review. Like you, I thought this was pretty middle of the road stuff. I'm wondering which ending you are talking about when you say you didn't like it. As I recall, there are at least three endings in this one (or things that one might point to as the ending).]]></body>

I was referring to of the endings "in general" as I just thought that given the monumental significance of the central plot, when the end comes, it just sort of...arrives. I was hoping for a little more earth-shatter.]]></body>

The ideas, the plot, the clues...I thought all of that was terrific. In the hands of a skilled writer/story-teller, it could have been epic. Still, it was entertaining despite the less than elegant prose.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I was so disappointed in this book. I agree it was just "meh" but for me meh=1 star. The whole book seemed like a giant chase scene. Run from the bad guys, stop and explain the plot. Run some more, stop and explain some more. Run some more, etc. The structure of the plot is just horrible. And that part you said about over-explaining everything? That's what middle-America needs to enjoy a novel. It's the reason this craptastic masterpiece sold 85 million copies. If that isn't reason enough to hate it...]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Ed wrote: "I don't expect everything I read to be fine lit-ra-chur.

I have read some truly poorly written and plotted books, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/970065.Killer_Crabs" title="Killer Crabs by Guy N. Smith" rel="nofollow">Killer Crabs</a> being the most recent example and this book is not even in the same species as books like that. I thought it was a decent popcorn thriller with a great concept and mediocre execution that kept me "mostly" entertained.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[<i>Tyson wrote: "I was so disappointed in this book. I agree it was just "meh" but for me meh=1 star..."</i><br /><br />For me, Meh is usually 2 stars with 1 star reserved for expressly my white hot rage that some publisher allowed a particular book to see the light of day. This was certainly above Meh for me though it is not the strongest 3 star book I've read (hence my 2.5 to 3.0 star rating).]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This book was okay. I would suggest you not read any of his other books. I haven't read the latest, but the first four read like an original movie and three Hollywood remakes. You know, all the same elements in a different order.<br /><br />The villain in all four is the same, the one chasing the heroes is the same, and so on.<br /><br />I read this one first, then Angels and Demons, followed by his third novel, then his first. As I was finishing my third book by him, I realized he was writing the same book every time. When I started to read my fourth by him, I determined to pick out the villain as early as possible. By page twenty-five, I picked out my suspect. Guess what, I was right.<br /><br />Luckily, I got them from my library and decided I still wasted my time. Never again a Dan Brown.]]></body>

I finally decided to read this because, being such an avid reader, I felt odd not having read one of the most popular books ever. So I ended up listening to the audiobook over the weekend laying by the pool and it was a good way to pass the time. It certainly wasn't horrible (in my opinion) and I'm glad I finally read/listened it, but it certainly won't change your life.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Great review. I think the historical concept is fascinating, but seeing as Dan Brown stole the idea, I give him ZERO credit. <br />IMHO Dan Brown should go back to selling insurance, as his writing is awful. What an awful plot to pair with such a fascinating subject. <br />I rarely have such strong negative feelings about a book or person. But Dan Brown gets way too much credit for the Templar/ da Vinci theories. He wouldn't even credit the historians who first wrote of the theories he stole... <br />Anyway, I loved this review. Well done. I wish you had written the book instead of DB.]]></body>
